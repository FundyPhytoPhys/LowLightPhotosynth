# Introduction

Polar phytoplankton are **vital** to polar ecosystems [@pierellakarlusich2020; @ardyna2020]. As photolithotrophs, phytoplankton rely on photons for energy input, nominally restricting their growth to the photic zone, defined as the region where sufficient light for photosynthesis penetrates, typically extending down to 1% of surface irradiance [@ravenPutOutLight2000; @kirk2011]

Despite severe light constraints, certain polar phytoplankton exhibit slow but significant growth under the ice during winter [@randelhoff2020; @hancke2018; @leu2015], suggesting photosynthetic adaptations to light limitation. To drive photosynthesis, Photosystem II (PSII) needs four sequential photons, with risk of losses through futile charge recombinations, if the photon arrivals are too widely spaced.

We hypothesized that maintaining photosynthesis under extremely low light and low temperatures involves **suppressing energetically wasteful charge recombinations** in PSII.

# Methods


Recombination causes a slippage in the four step cycle for a PSII, and thus causes desynchronization of the steps, across the population of Photosystem II [@gates2020].  For each PSII the yield of fluorescence varies across the four steps, and if PSII remain synchronized, the cells show four-step cycling of chlorophyll fluorescence. Therefore, **variable chlorophyll fluorescence** can be used to evaluate the synchronization of the PSII.  By inference, prolonged synchronization implies low recombination, and vice versa [@schubackSingleTurnoverVariableChlorophyll2021; @zaharievaEnergeticsKineticsSState2019].  

![Figure 2: Repeated single-turnover excitation of maximum variable chlorophyll fluorescence (F~M~) for monitoring PSII cycling of phytoplankton photosynthesis](StChlF.png)

We used Fast Fourier Transforms to analyze the persistence of PSII chlorophyll fluorescence four-step cycling across polar and temperate diatoms or green algae,  under a range of very low light and temperatures, to determine if polar taxa have evolved to increase photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency, by minimizing inefficient recombination reaction. 

# Results


![Figure 3: Duration of significant four-step cycling of PSII maximum chlorophyll fluorescence in polar and temperate diatoms or green algae, under a range of low light and temperature conditions. Wider spacing of photon delivery (y axis) is equivalent to lower ambient light. ](heatmap.png)

We observe **2** key patterns within, and between, taxa

* Within taxa, shorter spacing of photon delivery, and colder temperatures,  results in stronger four-step cycling of PSII maximum chlorophyll fluorescence, and by inference, less wasteful recombination.
* Polar taxa maintain significant four-step PSII cycling across a broader range of conditions, at wider spacings of photons, equivalent to lower ambient light, than do their temperate counterparts. 

# Conclusions
Our findings indicate that diverse polar phytoplankton have capacity to suppress wasteful recombinations at PSII, to sustain efficient photosynthesis under extreme low light and low temperatures.

This research challenges the conventional understanding of the limits on photosynthesis under light limitation, helping unravel polar ecosystem dynamics and predict ecosystem responses to climate change
