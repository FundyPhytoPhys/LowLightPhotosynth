This Review addresses four major complementary questions of ongoing Arctic Ocean changes and associated impacts on phytoplankton productivity, phenology and assemblage composition. We highlight trends in primary production over the last two decades while considering how multiple environmental drivers shape Arctic biogeography. Further, we consider changes to Arctic phenology by borealization and hidden under-ice blooms, and how the diversity of phytoplankton assemblages might evolve in a novel Arctic `biogeochemical landscape'. It is critical to understand these aspects of changing Arctic phytoplankton dynamics as they exert pressure on marine Arctic ecosystems in addition to direct effects from rapid environmental changes.},

The photosynthetic efficiency and maximum photosynthetic rate for sea ice microalgae increased as a function of incubation temperature between -6{$^\circ$} and + 6{$^\circ$} C. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency, maximum photosynthetic rate, and quantum yield were greatest at salinities between SO and 50 ppt. In contrast, the mean specific absorption coefficients were lowest near seawater salinities, and the saturating irradiance, Is, appeared to be inversely proportional to salinity. Results also suggest that the effects of salinity on the growth of sea ice microalgae are independent of those elicited by temperature or light, and that the functional relationship between salinity and light or temperature is multiplicative. This information is essential to the proper formulation of algorithms used to describe algal growth in environments where light, temperature, and salinity are changing simultaneously, such as within sea ice or within the water column at the marginal ice edge zone.},

  abstract = {During the MALINA cruise (summer 2009), an extensive effort was undertaken to isolate phytoplankton strains from the northeast (NE) Pacific Ocean, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. In order to characterise the main photosynthetic microorganisms occurring in the Arctic during the summer season, strains were isolated by flow cytometry sorting (FCS) and single cell pipetting before or after phytoplankton enrichment of seawater samples. Strains were isolated both onboard and back in the laboratory and cultured at 4 {$^\circ$}C under light/dark conditions. Overall, we isolated and characterised by light microscopy and 18 S rRNA gene sequencing 104 strains of photosynthetic flagellates which grouped into 21 genotypes (defined by 99.5\% 18 S rRNA gene sequence similarity), mainly affiliated to Chlorophyta and Heterokontophyta. The taxon most frequently isolated was an Arctic ecotype of the green algal genus Micromonas (Arctic Micromonas), which was nearly the only phytoplankter recovered within the picoplankton (Micromonas as well as other strains from the same class (Mamiellophyceae) were identified in further detail by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA operon. The MALINA Micromonas strains share identical 18 S rRNA and ITS sequences suggesting high genetic homogeneity within Arctic Micromonas. Three other Mamiellophyceae strains likely belong to a new genus. Other green algae from the genera Nephroselmis, Chlamydomonas, and Pyramimonas were also isolated, whereas Heterokontophyta included some unidentified Pelagophyceae, Dictyochophyceae (Pedinellales), and Chrysophyceae (Dinobryon faculiferum). Moreover, we isolated some Cryptophyceae (Rhodomonas sp.) as well as a few Prymnesiophyceae and dinoflagellates. We identified the dinoflagellate Woloszynskia cincta by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 28 S rRNA gene sequencing. Our morphological analyses show that this species possess the diagnostic features of the genus Biecheleria, and the 28 S rRNA gene topology corroborates this affiliation. We thus propose the transfer of W. cincta to the genus Biecheleria and its recombination as Biecheleria cincta.},

  abstract = {Precautionary conservation and cooperative global governance are needed to protect Antarctic blue carbon: the world's largest increasing natural form of carbon storage with high sequestration potential. As patterns of ice loss around Antarctica become more uniform, there is an underlying increase in carbon capture-to-storage-to-sequestration on the seafloor. The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1{$^\circ$}C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1{$^\circ$}C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs). In contrast, on the basis of past change and current research, we expect that Antarctic blue carbon could increase by orders of magnitude. The Antarctic seafloor is biophysically unique and the site of carbon sequestration, the benthos, faces less anthropogenic disturbance than any other ocean continental shelf environment. This isolation imparts both vulnerability to change, and an avenue to conserve one of the world's last biodiversity refuges. In economic terms, the value of Antarctic blue carbon is estimated at between {\pounds}0.65 and {\pounds}1.76~billion ({\textasciitilde}2.27~billion USD) for sequestered carbon in the benthos around the continental shelf. To balance biodiversity protection against society's economic objectives, this paper builds on a proposal incentivising protection by building a 'non-market framework' via the 2015 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This could be connected and coordinated through the Antarctic Treaty System to promote and motivate member states to value Antarctic blue carbon and maintain scientific integrity and conservation for the positive societal values ingrained in the Antarctic Treaty System.},

Recently, a multigene family of AFP genes was found in the diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, a dominant species within polar sea ice assemblages. This study presents the AFP from F. cylindrus set in a molecular and crystallographic frame. Differential protein expression after exposure of the diatoms to environmentally relevant conditions underlined the importance of certain AFP isoforms in response to cold. Analyses of the recombinant AFP showed freezing point depression comparable to the activity of other moderate AFPs and further enhanced by salt (up to 0.9{$^\circ$}C in low salinity buffer, 2.5{$^\circ$}C at high salinity). However, unlike other moderate AFPs, its fastest growth direction is perpendicular to the c-axis. The protein also caused strong inhibition of recrystallization at concentrations of 1.2 and 0.12{$\mu$}M at low and high salinity, respectively. Observations of crystal habit modifications and pitting activity suggested binding of AFPs to multiple faces of the ice crystals. Further analyses showed striations caused by AFPs, interpreted as inclusion in the ice. We suggest that the influence on ice microstructure is the main characteristic of these AFPs in sea ice.},

First, the polar night is not a period void of biological activity even though primary production is close to zero, but is rather characterized by a number of processes and interactions yet to be fully understood, including unanticipated high levels of feeding and reproduction in a wide range of taxa and habitats. Second, as more knowledge emerges, it is evident that a coupled physical and biological perspective of the ecosystem will redefine seasonality beyond the ``calendar perspective''. Third, it appears that many organisms may exhibit endogenous rhythms that trigger fitness-maximizing activities in the absence of light-based cues. Indeed a common adaptation appears to be the ability to utilize the dark season for reproduction. This and other processes are most likely adaptations to current environmental conditions and community and trophic structures of the ecosystem, and may have implications for how Arctic ecosystems can change under continued climatic warming.},

  abstract = {This document represents the collective efforts of SCOR Working Group 156, `Active Chlorophyll Fluorescence for Autonomous Measurements of Global Marine Primary Productivity'. The group was established in 2019, bringing together researchers and instrument manufacturers from 10 countries and 6 continents to develop standards of best practice in the application of single turnover active chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) for phytoplankton photo-physiology and productivity measurements. We focused our efforts on single turnover ChlF methods, which are most prevalent in phytoplankton research, while recognizing that other approaches, including Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorescence, are also commonly employed with macro-algae, corals and terrestrial plants. Some of the material in this document will apply to those related measurement techniques. During the period between 2019-2022, our group worked to build consensus around best practice for the collection, analysis, interpretation and archiving of ST-ChlF data from a variety of aquatic environments. This work was aimed at facilitating wide-spread use of ST-ChlF methods by the international research community, focussing on two key objectives outlined in the Working Group's terms of reference: 1. To develop, implement and document internationally-agreed best practice for the acquisition and analysis of ST-ChlF data to retrieve photosynthetic parameters and primary productivity estimates. 2. To develop, implement and document standardised ST-ChlF data output formats and archiving approaches. As a first step towards these objectives, we published a review article (Schuback et al. 2021), outlining applications, opportunities and current limitations of ST-ChlF measurements. This highlevel review was aimed at readers wishing to apply ST-ChlF methods and interpret the resulting data in the most robust manner possible. Journal length restrictions precluded in-depth treatment of many important topics, including instrument calibration, data fitting and spectral correction. In this User Guide, we expand on the material presented by Schuback et al. (2021), providing handson guidance for both experts and new users alike. With this document, we aim to provide both a strong theoretical background for ST-ChlF methods, and a practical handbook to inform the application of these methods across a wide range of aquatic environments. We assume that readers of have a basic understanding of aquatic photosynthesis, as outlined, for example, by Falkowski and Raven (2013). This document represents the first complete version of the SCOR ST-ChlF user guide. It is being released to the international research community for a period of open consultation. We encourage comments and suggestions, which can be addressed to the working group co-chairs, Philippe Tortell and David Suggett. We expect the contents of this User Guide to evolve significantly over time, through our own efforts and with input from other experts and end-users. Revised versions of the User Guide will be posted on the Ocean Best Practices site (https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/), and interested readers are encouraged to check periodically for updates. In follow up work, we aim to further develop existing open-source software (e.g. Ryan-Keogh and Robinson, 2021) to facilitate ST-ChlF data analysis from a range of different instruments and formats. This document is intended to serve the needs of a wide range of users, from novices (first year graduate students, for example) to expert researchers with decades of experience using ST-ChlF methods. We anticipate that some readers will require only high-level information on key operational parameters needed for successful ST-ChlF measurements, while others will be interested in further exploring the underlying ideas and concepts. For this reason, the document includes appendices that provide greater detail on some topics presented in the main document. In subsequent versions of this User Guide, we aim to include linked Jupyter notebooks, with handson tutorials and data processing tools. These software tools will help facilitate the inter-comparison of measurements collected by different users and instruments, supporting the development of globally-coherent ST-ChlF data compilations.},

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis sunlight is harvested and funneled as excitation energy into the reaction center (RC) of Photosystem II (PSII), the site of primary charge separation that initiates the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. The chlorophyll ChlD1 pigment of the RC is the primary electron donor, forming a charge-separated radical pair with the vicinal pheophytin PheoD1 (ChlD1+PheoD1-). To avert charge recombination, the electron is further transferred to plastoquinone QA, whereas the hole relaxes to a central pair of chlorophylls (PD1PD2), subsequently driving water oxidation. Spin-triplet states can form within the RC when forward electron transfer is inhibited or back reactions are favored. This can lead to formation of singlet dioxygen, with potential deleterious effects. Here we investigate the nature and properties of triplet states within the PSII RC using a multiscale quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) approach. The low-energy spectrum of excited singlet and triplet states, of both local and charge-transfer nature, is compared using range-separated time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). We further compute electron paramagnetic resonance properties (zero-field splitting parameters and hyperfine coupling constants) of relaxed triplet states and compare them with available experimental data. Moreover, the electrostatic modulation of excited state energetics and redox properties of RC pigments by the semiquinone QA- is described. The results provide a detailed electronic-level understanding of triplet states within the PSII RC and form a refined basis for discussing primary and secondary electron transfer, charge recombination pathways, and possible photoprotection mechanisms in PSII.},

IF1, therefore, preserves ATP at the expense of {$\Delta\psi$}m.

  abstract = {Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241 is a psychrophilic alga isolated from the deep photic zone of a perennially ice-covered Antarctic lake (east lobe Lake Bonney, ELB). Past studies have shown that C. sp. UWO241 exhibits constitutive downregulation of photosystem I (PSI) and high rates of PSI-associated cyclic electron flow (CEF). Iron levels in ELB are in the nanomolar range leading us to hypothesize that the unusual PSI phenotype of C. sp. UWO241 could be a response to chronic Fe-deficiency. We studied the impact of Fe availability in C. sp. UWO241, a mesophile, C. reinhardtii SAG11-32c, as well as a psychrophile isolated from the shallow photic zone of ELB, Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-MDV. Under Fe-deficiency, PsaA abundance and levels of photooxidizable P700 ({$\Delta$}A820/A820) were reduced in both psychrophiles relative to the mesophile. Upon increasing Fe, C. sp. ICE-MDV and C. reinhardtii exhibited restoration of PSI function, while C. sp. UWO241 exhibited only moderate changes in PSI activity and lacked almost all LHCI proteins. Relative to Fe-excess conditions (200~{\textmu}M Fe2+), C. sp. UWO241 grown in 18~{\textmu}M Fe2+ exhibited downregulation of light harvesting and photosystem core proteins, as well as upregulation of a bestrophin-like anion channel protein and two CEF-associated proteins (NdsS, PGL1). Key enzymes of starch synthesis and shikimate biosynthesis were also upregulated. We conclude that in response to variable Fe availability, the psychrophile C. sp. UWO241 exhibits physiological plasticity which includes restructuring of the photochemical apparatus, increased PSI-associated CEF, and shifts in downstream carbon metabolism toward storage carbon and secondary stress metabolites.},

  abstract = {Aureochromes constitute a family of blue light (BL) receptors which are found exclusively in heterokont algae such as diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) and yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae). Previous studies on the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum indicate that the formation of a high light acclimated phenotype is mediated by the absorption of BL and that aureochromes might play an important role in this process. P. tricornutum possesses four genes encoding aureochromes. In this study we confirm the nuclear localisation of the PtAUREO1a, 1b and 2 proteins. Furthermore we studied the physiology of light quality acclimation in genetically transformed P. tricornutum cell lines with reduced expression of the aureochrome 1a gene. The results demonstrate that the AUREO1a protein has a distinct function in light acclimation. However, rather unexpectedly AUREO1a seems to repress high light acclimation which resulted in a state of `hyper' high light acclimation in aureo1a silenced strains. This was indicated by characteristic changes of several photosynthetic parameters, including increased maximum photosynthesis rates, decreased chlorophyll a contents per cell and increased values of non-photochemical quenching in AUREO1a silenced strains compared to wild type cultures. Strikingly, AUREO1a silenced strains exhibited phenotypic differences compared to wild type cells during cultivation under BL as well as under red light (RL) conditions. Therefore, AUREO1a might influence the RL signalling process, suggesting an interaction of AUREO1a with RL perception pathways.},

How Arctic diatom photoadaptation strategies differ across their heterogeneous light niches remains a poorly documented but crucial missing link to anticipate Arctic Ocean responses to shrinking sea-ice and increasing light. To address this question, we selected five Arctic diatom species with diverse life traits, representative of distinct light niches across the seasonal light environment continuum: from snow-covered dimly lit bottom ice to summer stratified waters. We studied their photoacclimation plasticity to two growth light levels and the subsequent responses of their nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and xanthophyll cycle to both dark incubations and light shifts. We deciphered NPQ and xanthophyll cycle tuning in darkness and their light-dependent induction kinetics, which aligned with species' light niche occupancy. In ice-related species, NPQ was sustained in darkness and its induction was more reactive to moderate light shifts. Open-water species triggered strong NPQ induction in darkness and reached higher maximal NPQ under high light. Marginal ice zone species showed strong adaptation to light fluctuations with a dark response fine-tuned depending upon light history. We argue these traits are anchored in diverging photoadaption strategies fostering Arctic diatom success in their respective light niches.},

Many cold-water algae are psychrophiles that thrive in the cold but cannot grow at moderate temperatures ({$\geq$}20{$^\circ$}C). Polar regions are at risk of rapid warming caused by climate change, and the sensitivity of psychrophilic algae to rising temperatures makes them, and the ecosystems they inhabit, particularly vulnerable. Recent research on the Antarctic psychrophile Chlamydomonas priscuii, an emerging algal model, has revealed unique adaptations to life in the permanent cold. Additionally, genome sequencing of C. priscuii and its relative Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L has given rise to a plethora of computational tools that can help elucidate the genetic basis of psychrophily. This minireview summarizes new advances in characterizing the heat stress responses in psychrophilic algae and examines their extraordinary sensitivity to temperature increases.

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis, a complete water oxidation cycle requires absorption of four photons by the chlorophylls of photosystem II (PSII). The photons can be provided successively by applying short flashes of light. Already in 1970, Kok and coworkers [Photochem Photobiol 11:457--475, 1970] developed a basic model to explain the flash-number dependence of O2 formation. The third flash applied to dark-adapted PSII induces the S3{$\rightarrow$}S4{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition, which is coupled to dioxygen formation at a protein-bound Mn4Ca complex. The sequence of events leading to dioxygen formation and the role of Kok's enigmatic S4-state are only incompletely understood. Recently we have shown by time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy that in the S3{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition an interesting intermediate is formed, prior to the onset of O--O bond formation [Haumann et~al. Science 310:1019--1021, 2005]. The experimental results of the time-resolved X-ray experiments are discussed. The identity of the reaction intermediate is considered and the question is addressed how the novel intermediate is related to the S4-state proposed in 1970 by Bessel Kok. This leads us to an extension of the classical S-state cycle towards a basic model which describes sequence and interplay of electron and proton abstraction events at the donor side of PSII [Dau and Haumann, Science 312:1471--1472, 2006].},

  abstract = {There is considerable interest in improving plant productivity by altering the dynamic responses of photosynthesis in tune with natural conditions. This is exemplified by the `energy-dependent' form of non-photochemical quenching (qE), the formation and decay of which can be considerably slower than natural light fluctuations, limiting photochemical yield. In addition, we recently reported that rapidly fluctuating light can produce field recombination-induced photodamage (FRIP), where large spikes in electric field across the thylakoid membrane ({$\Delta\psi$}) induce photosystem II recombination reactions that produce damaging singlet oxygen (1O2). Both qE and FRIP are directly linked to the thylakoid proton motive force (pmf), and in particular, the slow kinetics of partitioning pmf into its {$\Delta$}pH and {$\Delta\psi$} components. Using a series of computational simulations, we explored the possibility of `hacking' pmf partitioning as a target for improving photosynthesis. Under a range of illumination conditions, increasing the rate of counter-ion fluxes across the thylakoid membrane should lead to more rapid dissipation of {$\Delta\psi$} and formation of {$\Delta$}pH. This would result in increased rates for the formation and decay of qE while resulting in a more rapid decline in the amplitudes of {$\Delta\psi$}-spikes and decreasing 1O2 production. These results suggest that ion fluxes may be a viable target for plant breeding or engineering. However, these changes also induce transient, but substantial mismatches in the ATP : NADPH output ratio as well as in the osmotic balance between the lumen and stroma, either of which may explain why evolution has not already accelerated thylakoid ion fluxes. Overall, though the model is simplified, it recapitulates many of the responses seen in vivo, while spotlighting critical aspects of the complex interactions between pmf components and photosynthetic processes. By making the programme available, we hope to enable the community of photosynthesis researchers to further explore and test specific hypotheses. This article is part of the themed issue `Enhancing photosynthesis in crop plants: targets for improvement'.},

  abstract = {Different representative of algae and cyanobacteria were isolated from a freshwater habitat and cultivated in laboratory to compare their photoacclimation capacity when exposed to a wide range of light intensity and to understand if this factor may modify natural community dominance. All species successfully acclimated to all light intensities and the response of phytoplankton to increased light intensity was similar and included a decrease of most photosynthetic pigments accompanied by an increase in photoprotective pigment content relative to Chl a. Most species also decreased their light absorption efficiency on a biovolume basis. This decrease not only resulted in a lower fraction of energy absorbed by the cell, but also to a lower transfer of energy to PSII and PSI. Furthermore, energy funnelled to PSII or PSI was also rearranged in favour of PSII. High light acclimated organisms also corresponded to high non-photochemical quenching and photosynthetic electron transport reduction state and to a low {$\Phi$}'M. Thus photoacclimation processes work toward reducing the excitation pressure in high light environment through a reduction of light absorption efficiency, but also by lowering conversion efficiency. Interestingly, all species of our study followed that tendency despite being of different functional groups (colonial, flagellated, different sizes) and of different phylogeny demonstrating the great plasticity and adaptation ability of freshwater phytoplankton to their light environment. These adjustments may explain the decoupling between growth rate and photosynthesis observed above photosynthesis light saturation point for all species. Even if some species did reach higher growth rate in our conditions and thus, should dominate in natural environment with respect to light intensity, we cannot exclude that other environmental factors also influence the population dynamic and make the outcome harder to predict.},

The damping is attributed to `misses' resulting from a statistical probability that a reaction center fails to produce a stable charge separation after a saturating flash. The origin of misses is of interest because its probable dependence on flash number, in principle, affects the quantitative interpretation of all measurements on phenomena associated with the period four oscillation. We show that the kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence yield transients induced by a flash series can be used to estimate the relative amplitudes of the miss probability on each flash. It is concluded that a major part of the misses must be caused by failure of the reduction of the oxidized primary electron donor chlorophyll P680+ by the secondary donor tyrosine YZ before the charge separation is lost by recombination. The probability of this failure is found to increase with the oxidation state of the oxygen-evolving complex: more than half of it occurs upon charge separation in the S3 state, which is attributed to the presence of YZox S2 in Boltzmann equilibrium with YZS3.},

They are able to acclimate to fast changes in the light intensity by various mechanisms including a rise in non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ). The latter has been attributed to the xanthophyll cycle (XC) following activation of diadinoxanthin de-epoxidase by the acidification of the thylakoid lumen. To examine whether fluorescence quenching in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum depends on the {$\Delta$}pH generated by the photosynthetic electron transport, we arrested the latter by 3-(3{$\prime$},4{$\prime$}-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). This treatment hardly affected the NPQ or XC, even when methylviologen was present. Dissipation of the {$\Delta$}pH by 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited the XC but did not alter NPQ. Similar results, i.e. inhibition of the XC but normal fluorescence quenching, were observed when the experiments were performed at 3{$^\circ$}C. Measurements of thermoluminescence showed that excess light treatment caused a marked decline in the signals obtained as a result of recombination of QB- with the S3 state of the Mn cluster; this was also observed in cells treated with DCMU (recombination of QA- with S2). Light treatment also diminished the QA- re-oxidation signals. The data suggest that changes in PSII core centre itself due to exposure to excess light conditions play an important part in the acclimation of P. tricornutum to the changing light conditions.},

  abstract = {The absorption of visible light in aquatic environments has led to the common assumption that aquatic organisms sense and adapt to penetrative blue/green light wavelengths but show little or no response to the more attenuated red/far-red wavelengths. Here, we show that two marine diatom species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, possess a bona fide red/far-red light sensing phytochrome (DPH) that uses biliverdin as a chromophore and displays accentuated red-shifted absorbance peaks compared with other characterized plant and algal phytochromes. Exposure to both red and far-red light causes changes in gene expression in P. tricornutum, and the responses to far-red light disappear in DPH knockout cells, demonstrating that P. tricornutum DPH mediates far-red light signaling. The identification of DPH genes in diverse diatom species widely distributed along the water column further emphasizes the ecological significance of far-red light sensing, raising questions about the sources of far-red light. Our analyses indicate that, although far-red wavelengths from sunlight are only detectable at the ocean surface, chlorophyll fluorescence and Raman scattering can generate red/far-red photons in deeper layers. This study opens up novel perspectives on phytochrome-mediated far-red light signaling in the ocean and on the light sensing and adaptive capabilities of marine phototrophs.},

  abstract = {The photosynthetic characteristics and pigment contents of Oscillatoria redekei van Goor were measured under a range of photoperiods (6:18 light-dark to continuous light) and irradiances (13--260 {\textmu}E m-2 s-1) at 15{$^\circ$}C. The light saturated rate of photosynthesis (P max) per cell protein was found to be comparatively constant under different light regimes but cells grown under low irradiances and/or short light-dark (LD) cycles showed marked increases in the efficiency with which they harvested low light. The increase in efficiency under low light doses corresponded to an increase in the phycocyanin and chlorophyll a content of the cultures but phycocyanin content was observed to increase by a greater proportion than chlorophyll a. The increase in the ratio of phycocyanin to chlorophyll a was highly correlated with increases in the efficiency of light harvesting. Cells grown under 6:18 LD cycles had a pigment composition similar to low light cultures grown under continuous light. Because of wide differences in the pigment content of continuous light cultures, the light saturation characteristic I k varied over a wide range from 77 to 462 {\textmu}E m-2 s-1, compared to a range of 78--140 {\textmu}E m-2 s-1 for cells grown under a 6:18 LD cycle. In addition, the range of compensation irradiances for continuous light cells was 4--82 {\textmu}E m-2 s-1 compared to 3--6 {\textmu}E m-2 s-1 for 6:18 LD cells. The large difference between continuous light and LD cells was due in part to the high respiration rates of continuous light cells.}

This method determines the transit times of electrons that pass through PSII during the successive steps in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation/O2 formation (S states) and plastoquinone reduction in any oxygenic phototroph (in vivo or in vitro). We report the first measurements from intact living cells, illustrated by a eukaryotic alga (Nannochloropsis oceanica). We demonstrate that S state transition times depend strongly on the redox state of the PSII acceptor side, at both QB and the plastoquinone pool which serve as the major locus of regulation of PSII electron flux. We provide evidence for a kinetic intermediate S3{$\prime$} state (lifetime 220 {$\mu$}s) following formation of S3 and prior to the release of O2. We compare the FRRF-detected kinetics to other previous spectroscopic methods (optical absorbance, EPR, and XES) that are applicable only to in vitro samples.},

Fluctuating light influences photosynthesis, respiration, biosynthesis, and growth at different timescales, but the interplay of these processes is not well-understood. Subsamples of a phytoplankton community from the turbid, well-mixed lake TaiHu (China) were either vertically moved through different mixing depths or incubated at fixed depths of matching daily light supply. Growth, photosynthetic electron transport rates, net oxygen production, and night respiration were measured for 9 days. Production was investigated during cyclic mixing, throughout the day, and among days of different integral light intensities. Electron transport rates were higher during vertical mixing and increased with mixing depth, therefore mixing phytoplankton better exploited short periods of surface illumination. On the other hand, light-stimulation of oxygen consumption and photoperiod shortening increased the compensation light intensities for daily production and growth. The communities kept at the surface and sub-surface were photoinhibited; their net oxygen production declined and compensation light intensity increased in the afternoon. There was no sign of afternoon depression of net oxygen production in mixing phytoplankton which metabolized photosynthetic products in periodic phases of low light in deeper layers. Mixing phytoplankton produced more oxygen during increasing light intensities and respired more at decreasing light intensities, decreasing net oxygen production during the day. This cyclic post-illumination enhancement of respiration seemed to be hardwired to fluctuating light, regardless of mixing depth and uncoupled from night respiration rates. Photosynthesis and respiration seemed more tightly connected under fluctuating than constant light.},

Onset of the spring bloom of ice algae is typically limited by the availability of light, and the current consensus is that a few tens-of-centimeters of snow is enough to prevent sufficient solar radiation to reach underneath the sea ice. We challenge this consensus, and investigated the onset and the light requirement of an ice algae spring bloom, and the importance of snow optical properties for light penetration. Colonization by ice algae began in May under {$>$}1 m of first-year sea ice with {$\sim$}1 m thick snow cover on top, in NE Greenland. The initial growth of ice algae began at extremely low irradiance ({$<$}0.17 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1) and was documented as an increase in Chlorophyll a concentration, an increase in algal cell number, and a viable photosynthetic activity. Snow thickness changed little during May (from 110 to 91 cm), however the snow temperature increased steadily, as observed from automated high-frequency temperature profiles. We propose that changes in snow optical properties, caused by temperature-driven snow metamorphosis, was the primary driver for allowing sufficient light to penetrate through the thick snow and initiate algae growth below the sea ice. This was supported by radiative-transfer modeling of light attenuation. Implications are an earlier productivity by ice algae in Arctic sea ice than recognized previously.},

Lowering the number of turnovers of proton-producing redox components by decreasing the flash intensity increased the number of flashes required for the onset of ATP formation. Thus, regardless of the intensity, the accumulation of the same number of hydrogen ions was needed for phosphorylation to begin. Since the size of the threshold input was constant over a very wide range of proton accumulation rates, it follows that there were no significant proton leakages during the filling of the pool to its threshold level. However, non-productive leaks were initiated once phosphorylation began since progressively lower phosphorylation efficiencies were observed at lower and lower flash intensities. It is difficult to explain this observation except in terms of competing, non-phosphorylating hydrogen ion fluxes only when the threshold accumulation had been reached. We observed an increase in the permeability of thylakoid membrane to hydrogen ions that correlated with indications of coupling factor activity: the onset of ATP synthesis, the release of tightly bound ADP and, in dithiothreitol treated membranes, the initiation of ATPase activity. Our data support the notion that the dependence of coupling factor activation and deactivation on the {$\Delta$}pH accounts for the substantial changes in the ion conductivity that occur in thylakoid membranes.},

Lakes Hoare and Vanda are in the Dry Valley region of Southern Victoria Land, and are both perennially ice covered. The model combines experimentally derived observations of light/photosynthesis relationships and rates of respiration of mats from a range of depths in these lakes, with data on incident radiation and the optical properties of the ice and water column. The model was used to estimate daily and annual production and, using measured carbon content, the potential vertical accumulation of the mats over a year. An annual pattern of photosynthesis was predicted for both lakes, with net production from October to February and net respiration at other times. Predicted rates and patterns of net photosynthesis were remarkably similar in the two lakes, despite differences in light climate: the ice of Lake Hoare transmits 1--4\% incident radiation, whereas that of Lake Vanda transmits up to 20\%. Maximum daily rates of 15--20 {$\mu$}g carbon cm-2 were predicted to occur at approximately 10 m depth in both lakes. Maximum annual rates of carbon fixation (at 10--12 m depth) in both lakes were c. 1.2 mg carbon cm-2 equating to approximately 0.1--4 mm vertical accumulation of mat each year. Experimental studies of microbial mats in the lakes revealed horizontal laminations of similar thickness to model estimates, supporting the hypothesis that these were annual layers. Differences between model estimates and observations were found in deeper water in Lake Vanda, where considerably more material accumulated than was predicted.},

  abstract = {Understanding the role of the xanthophyll cycle and elucidating the mechanisms of antenna quenching through the non-photochemical dissipation of excess absorbed energy in the photoprotection of the photochemical apparatus continues to be a major focus of photosynthetic research. In addition to antenna quenching, there is evidence for the non-photochemical dissipation of excess energy through the PS II reaction center. Hence, this photoprotective mechanism is called reaction center quenching. One technique to assess reaction center quenching is photosynthetic thermoluminescence. This technique represents a simple but powerful probe of PS II photochemistry that measures the light emitted due to the reversal of PS II charge separation through the thermally-dependent recombination of the negative charges stabilized on Q-A and Q-B on the acceptor side of PS II with the positive charges accumulated in the S2- and S3-states of the oxygen evolving complex. Changes in the temperature maxima for photosynthetic thermoluminescence may reflect changes in redox potentials of recombining species within PS II reaction centers. Exposure of Synechococcussp. PCC 7942, Pinus sylvestrisL., Arabidopsis thaliana, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to either lowtemperatures or to high light induces a significant downshift in the temperature maxima for S2Q-B and S3Q-B recombinations relative to S2Q-A and S3Q-A recombinations. These shifts in recombination temperatures are indicative of lower activation energy for the S2Q-B redox pair recombination and a narrowing of the free energy gap betweenQAandQB electron acceptors. This, in turn, is associated with a decrease in the overall thermoluminescence emission. We propose that environmental factors such as high light and low temperature result in an increased population of reduced QA (Q-A), that is, increased excitation pressure, facilitating non-radiative P680+Q-A radical pair recombination within the PS II reaction center. The underlying molecular mechanisms regulating reaction center quenching appear to be species dependent. We conclude that reaction center quenching and antenna quenching are complementary mechanisms that may function to photoprotect PS II to different extents in vivo depending on the species as well as the environmental conditions to which the organism is exposed.},

The psychrophile, Chlamydomonas priscuii, is endemic to Lake Bonney, Antarctica. Adaptation to its extreme polar environment includes homeoviscous adaptation of membranes, maintenance of energy balance through photostasis and surface area to volume ratio. In addition to these mechanisms, this psychrophile can exist in culture as motile, single cells or as immobile, multicellular palmelloids. Comparative biochemical, physiological, microscopic and spectroscopic analyses of purified single cells and palmelloids indicate that the conversion of single cells to multicellular palmelloids alters the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus. This enhances photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus from light and low temperature stress by minimizing potential cellular energy imbalances and safely dissipating excessive excitation energy by nonphotochemical quenching mechanisms. In addition to decreased susceptibility to predation, enhanced photoprotection from photoinhibition associated with palmelloid formation may be a complementary, selective, evolutionary advantage for the induction of multicellularity in green algae.},

A typical sequence for a plant cryptochrome was not found in our analysis of the Phaeodactylum tricornutum genome, but one protein grouped with higher plant and green algal cryptochromes. This protein, CryP, binds FAD and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, according to our spectroscopic studies on heterologously expressed protein. 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate binding is a feature common to both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases and DASH cryptochromes. In recombinant CryP, however, the FAD chromophore was present in its neutral radical state and had a red-shifted absorption maximum at 637 nm, which is more characteristic for a DASH cryptochrome than a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase. Upon illumination with blue light, the fully reduced state of FAD was formed in the presence of reductant. Expression of CryP was silenced by antisense approaches, and the resulting cell lines showed increased levels of proteins of light-harvesting complexes, the Lhcf proteins, in vivo. In contrast, the levels of proteins active in light protection, the Lhcx proteins, were reduced. Thus, CryP cannot be directly grouped with known members of the cryptochrome/photolyase family. Of all P. tricornutum proteins, it is the most similar in sequence to a plant cryptochrome, and is involved in the regulation of light-harvesting protein expression, but shows spectroscopic features and a chromophore composition that are most typical of a DASH cryptochrome.},

Here, we investigated the acclimation of Phaeodactylum tricornutum to different light quality with respect to growth rate, photosynthesis rate, macromolecular composition and the metabolic profile by shifting the light quality from red light (RL) to blue light (BL) and vice versa. Our results show that cultures pre-acclimated to BL and RL exhibited similar growth performance, photosynthesis rates and metabolite profiles. However, light shift experiments revealed rapid and severe changes in the metabolite profile within 15 min as the initial reaction of light acclimation. Thus, during the shift from RL to BL, increased concentrations of amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates were observed whereas during the BL to RL shift the levels of amino acids were decreased and intermediates of glycolysis accumulated. Accordingly, on the time scale of hours the RL to BL shift led to a redirection of carbon into the synthesis of proteins, whereas during the BL to RL shift an accumulation of carbohydrates occurred. Thus, a vast metabolic reorganization of the cells was observed as the initial reaction to changes in light quality. The results are discussed with respect to a putative direct regulation of cellular enzymes by light quality and by transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, the short-term changes in the metabolome were accompanied by changes in the degree of reduction of the plastoquinone pool. Surprisingly, the RL to BL shift led to a severe inhibition of growth within the first 48 h which was not observed during the BL to RL shift. Furthermore, during the phase of growth arrest the photosynthetic performance did not change. We propose arguments that the growth arrest could have been caused by the reorganization of intracellular carbon partitioning.},

The four cruises in the Antarctic marginal ice edge zones, combined with the summer cruise in Prydz Bay during a brief ice-free period (1988) provided us with opportunities for spatial and seasonal studies of diatom abundance and distribution in the water column. Cells from discrete water samples from 73 stations near the marginal ice-edge zones during all seasons were counted to gain quantitative information on the composition, abundance, and distribution of diatoms. Diatom abundance was dominated by the pennate diatom, usually nanoplanktonic, Fragilariopsis cylindrus (Grunow) Krieger, during all five cruises. The highest integrated numbers of F. cylindrus were found during the summer cruise with 7.9 {\texttimes} 1010 cells m-2 and the lowest numbers were found during the winter cruise with 1.1 {\texttimes} 108 cells m-2. The average integrated abundance of F. cylindrus from the five cruises was about 35\% of the total diatom abundance. The overall spatial pattern of F. cylindrus near the marginal ice-edge zones during the five seasonal cruises were similar with the highest number of cells in open waters compared to ice-covered waters. When all 73 stations during the five cruises were included in the correlation analysis, the abundance of total diatoms was positively correlated with the abundance of F. cylindrus, suggesting that the ice-edge pulses of diatom assemblages in the water column largely reflected its abundance. Cluster analysis revealed that the stations in marginal ice-edge zones were not only separated by seasons and locations, but they also separated based on location of stations in relation to the ice edge (open water stations vs. ice-covered stations).},

The PSII core complex from cyanobacteria consists of 17 transmembrane subunits and 3 extrinsic subunits with a total molecular mass of approximately 350 kDa per monomer, and PSII exists predominately in a dimeric form in vivo. This chapter describes the purification procedures leading to highly pure, homogenous, and highly active PSII core dimers from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (T. vulcanus), that are used for successful crystallization and diffraction at atomic resolution. The purity and homogeneity of the PSII dimers thus obtained are characterized by absorption spectra, low-temperature fluorescence spectra, SDS-PAGE, clear native PAGE, blue native PAGE, gel filtration chromatography, and oxygen-evolving activity measurements. Finally, high-quality crystals obtained from the purified PSII dimers are shown.},

The ability of Antarctic sea-ice diatoms to survive this prolonged darkness relies on their metabolic capability. This study is the first to examine the proteome of a prominent sea-ice diatom in response to extended darkness, focusing on the protein-level mechanisms of dark survival. The Antarctic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus was grown under continuous light or darkness for 120 d. The whole cell proteome was quantitatively analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS to investigate metabolic changes that occur during sustained darkness and during recovery under illumination. Enzymes of metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in respiratory processes, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the urea cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain became more abundant in the dark. Within the plastid, carbon fixation halted while the upper sections of the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathways became less active. We have discovered how F. cylindrus utilises an ancient alternative metabolic mechanism that enables its capacity for long-term dark survival. By sustaining essential metabolic processes in the dark, F. cylindrus retains the functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus, ensuring rapid recovery upon re-illumination.},

The following observations and conclusions are reported: 1. Light flashes always produce the same number of oxidizing equivalents either as precursor or as O2. 2. The number of unstable precursor equivalents present during steady state photosynthesis is {$\sim$} 1.2 per photochemical trapping center. 3. The cooperation of the four photochemically formed oxidizing equivalents occurs essentially in the individual reaction centers and the final O2 evolution step is a one quantum process. 4. The data are compatible with a linear four step mechanism in which a trapping center, or an associated catalyst, (S) successively accumulates four + charges. The S4+ state produces O2 and returns to the ground state S0. 5. Besides S0 also the first oxidized state S+ is stable in the dark, the two higher states, S2+ and S3+ are not. 6. The relaxation times of some of the photooxidation steps were estimated. The fastest reaction, presumably S*1{\textleftarrow}S2, has a (first) half time {$\leq$} 200 {$\mu$}sec. The S*2 state and probably also the S*0 state are processed somewhat more slowly ({\texttildelow} 300--400 {$\mu$}sec).},

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses (`flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 Ws to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption crosssection decreased by about 40\%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of cPS II, p, and the kinetics of Q3A reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energyconversion. {\ss} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Despite numerous studies on overwintering strategies, such as utilization of stored energy products, formation of resting stages, reduction of metabolic rates and heterotrophic lifestyles, there have been few attempts to assess the in situ physiological state and restoration of the photosynthetic apparatus upon re-illumination. In this study, we found diverse and active marine phytoplankton communities during the polar night at 78{$^\circ$}N. Furthermore, we observed rapid changes ({$\leq$}20 min) in the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport upon re-illumination. High photosynthetic capacity and net primary production were established after 24 h of re-illumination. Our results suggest that some Arctic autotrophs maintain fully functional photosystem II and downstream electron acceptors during the polar night even though the low in situ net primary production levels measured in January prove that light was not sufficient to support any measurable primary production. Due to low temperatures resulting in low respiratory rates as well as the absence of photodamage during the polar night, maintenance of basic photosynthetic machinery may actually pose relatively low metabolic costs for algal cells. This could allow Arctic microalgae to endure the polar night without the formation of dormant stages, enabling them to recover and take advantage of light immediately upon the suns return during the winter--spring transition.},

  abstract = {Plants are often exposed to external conditions that adversely affect their growth, development or productivity. Such unfavourable environmental stress factors may result in rapid and transient increases of intracellular concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are chemically distinct and impact plants either by being cytotoxic or by acting as a signal. Because different ROS are generated simultaneously in different cellular and extracellular compartments, it is almost impossible to link a particular ROS to a specific stress response and to determine its mode of action. The conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis has been used to determine the biological role of singlet oxygen. Immediately after a dark/light shift of the flu mutant, singlet oxygen is generated within the plastids activating several stress responses that include growth inhibition of mature plants and seedling lethality. These stress responses do not result from physicochemical damage caused by singlet oxygen, but are attributable to the activation of a genetically determined stress response programme triggered by the Executer1 protein. Singlet oxygen-mediated stress responses at the transcriptional level necessitate a retrograde transduction of signals from the chloroplast to the nucleus that activate distinct sets of genes different from those that are induced by superoxide/hydrogen peroxide. Hence, the biological activities of these two types of ROS are distinct from each other. Whether they act independently or interact is not known yet and is the topic of our current research.},

Our recent demonstration of the unusually effective photoprotection by the xanthophyll cycle in diatoms [Lavaud et al. (2002) Plant Physiol 129 (3) (in press)] also revealed that failure of this protection led to inactivation of oxygen evolution, but not to the expected photoinhibition. Photo-oxidative damage might be prevented by an electron transfer cycle around Photosystem II (PS II). The induction of such a cycle at high light intensity was verified by measurements of the flash number dependence of oxygen production in a series of single-turnover flashes. After a few minutes of saturating illumination, the oxygen flash yields are temporarily decreased. The deficit in oxygen production amounts to at most 3 electrons per PS II, but continues to reappear with a half time of 2 min in the dark until the total pool of reducing equivalents accumulated during the illumination has been consumed by (chloro)respiration. This is attributed to an electron transfer pathway from the plastoquinone pool or the acceptor side of PS II to the donor side of PS II that is insignificant at limiting light intensity but is accelerated to milliseconds at excess light intensity. Partial filling of the 3-equivalents capacity of the cyclic electron transfer path in PS II may prevent both acceptor-side photoinhibition in oxygen-evolving PS II and donor-side photoinhibition when the oxygen-evolving complex is temporarily inactivated.},

  abstract = {Water quality deterioration is expected to worsen the light conditions in shallow coastal waters with increasing human activities. Temperate seagrasses are known to tolerate a highly fluctuating light environment. However, depending on their ability to adjust to some decline in light conditions, decreases in daily light quantity and quality could affect seagrass physiology, productivity, and, eventually, survival if the Minimum Quantum Requirements (MQR) are not reached. To better understand if, how, and to what extent photosynthetic adjustments contribute to light acclimation, eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) shoots from the cold temperate St. Lawrence marine estuary (Rimouski, QC, Canada) were exposed to seven light intensity treatments (6, 36, 74, 133, 355, 503, and 860 {$\mu$}mol photons m--2 s--1, 14:10 light:dark photoperiod). Photosynthetic capacity and efficiency were quantified after five and 25 days of light exposure by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry to assess the rapid response of the photosynthetic apparatus and its acclimation potential. Photoacclimation was also studied through physiological responses of leaves and shoots (gross and net primary production, pigment content, and light absorption). Shoots showed proof of photosynthetic adjustments at irradiances below 200 {$\mu$}mol photons m--2 s--1, which was identified as the threshold between limiting and saturating irradiances. Rapid Light Curves (RLC) and net primary production (NPP) rates revealed sustained maximal photosynthetic rates from the highest light treatments down to 74 {$\mu$}mol photons m--2 s--1, while a compensation point (NPP = 0) of 13.7 {$\mu$}mol photons m--2 s--1 was identified. In addition, an important package effect was observed, since an almost three-fold increase in chlorophyll content in the lowest compared to the highest light treatment did not change the leaves' light absorption. These results shed new light on photosynthetic and physiological processes, triggering light acclimation in cold temperate eelgrass. Our study documents an MQR value for eelgrass in the St. Lawrence estuary, which is highly pertinent in the context of conservation and restoration of eelgrass meadows.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems at high latitudes are characterized by extreme seasonal changes in light conditions, as well as a limited period of high primary production during spring and early summer. As light returns at the end of winter to Arctic ice-covered seas, a first algal bloom takes place in the bottom layer of the sea ice. This bottom ice algae community develops through three distinct phases in the transition from winter to spring, starting with phase I, a predominantly net heterotroph community that has limited interaction with the pelagic or benthic realms. Phase II begins in the spring once light for photosynthesis becomes available at the ice bottom, although interaction with the water column and benthos remains limited. The transition to the final phase III is then mainly driven by a balance of atmospheric and oceanographic forcing that induce structural changes in the sea ice and ultimately the removal of algal biomass from the ice. Due to limited data availability an incomplete understanding exists of all the processes determining ice algal bloom phenology and the considerable geographic differences in sympagic algal standing stocks and primary production. We present here the first pan-Arctic compilation of available time-series data on vernal sea ice algal bloom development and identify the most important factors controlling its development and termination. Using data from the area surrounding Resolute Bay (Nunavut, Canada) as an example, we support previous investigations that snow cover on top of the ice influences sea ice algal phenology, with highest biomass development, but also earliest termination of blooms, under low snow cover. We also provide a pan-Arctic overview of sea ice algae standing stocks and primary production, and discuss the pertinent processes behind the geographic differences we observed. Finally, we assess potential future changes in vernal algal bloom phenology as a consequence of climate change, including their importance to different groups of grazers.},

To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low-light, high-nutrient, ice-covered spring and the high-light, low-nutrient, ice-free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become ``primed'' for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.},

  abstract = {The relation between fatty acid accumulation, activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and consequently lipid accumulation was studied in the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris co-immobilized with the plant growth-promoting bacterium Azospirillum brasilense under dark heterotrophic conditions with Na acetate as a carbon source. In C. vulgaris immobilized alone, cultivation experiments for 6~days showed that ACC activity is directly related to fatty acid accumulation, especially in the last 3~days. In co-immobilization experiments, A. brasilense exerted a significant positive effect over ACC activity, increased the quantity in all nine main fatty acids, increased total lipid accumulation in C. vulgaris, and mitigated negative effects of nonoptimal temperature for growth. No correlation between ACC activity and lipid accumulation in the cells was established for three different temperatures. This study demonstrated that the interaction between A. brasilense and C. vulgaris has a significant effect on fatty acid and lipid accumulation in the microalgae.},

  abstract = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MCM) of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, harbor numerous ice-covered bodies of water that provide year-round liquid water oases for isolated food webs dominated by the microbial loop. Single-cell microbial eukaryotes (protists) occupy major trophic positions within this truncated food web, ranging from primary producers (e.g., chlorophytes, haptophytes, and cryptophytes) to tertiary predators (e.g., ciliates, dinoflagellates, and choanoflagellates). To advance the understanding of MCM protist ecology and the roles of MCM protists in nutrient and energy cycling, we investigated potential metabolic strategies and microbial interactions of key MCM protists isolated from a well-described lake (Lake Bonney). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of enrichment cultures, combined with single amplified genome/amplicon sequencing and fluorescence microscopy, revealed that MCM protists possess diverse potential metabolic capabilities and interactions. Two metabolically distinct bacterial clades (Flavobacteria and Methylobacteriaceae) were independently associated with two key MCM lake microalgae (Isochrysis and Chlamydomonas, respectively). We also report on the discovery of two heterotrophic nanoflagellates belonging to the Stramenopila supergroup, one of which lives as a parasite of Chlamydomonas, a dominate primary producer in the shallow, nutrient-poor layers of the lake. IMPORTANCE Single-cell eukaryotes called protists play critical roles in the cycling of organic matter in aquatic environments. In the ice-covered lakes of Antarctica, protists play key roles in the aquatic food web, providing the majority of organic carbon to the rest of the food web (photosynthetic protists) and acting as the major consumers at the top of the food web (predatory protists). In this study, we utilized a combination of techniques (microscopy, cell sorting, and genomic analysis) to describe the trophic abilities of Antarctic lake protists and their potential interactions with other microbes. Our work reveals that Antarctic lake protists rely on metabolic versatility for their energy and nutrient requirements in this unique and isolated environment.},

In this perspective, we review the recent progress on the repair dynamics and mechanisms of both types of DNA restoration by photolyases. We first report the spectroscopic characterization of flavin in various redox states and the active-site solvation dynamics in photolyases. We then systematically summarize the detailed repair dynamics of damaged DNA by photolyases and a biomimetic system through resolving all elementary steps on the ultrafast timescales, including multiple intermolecular electron- and proton-transfer reactions and bond-breaking and -making processes. We determined the unique electron tunneling pathways, identified the key functional residues and revealed the molecular origin of high repair efficiency, and thus elucidate the molecular mechanisms and repair photocycles at the most fundamental level. We finally conclude that the active sites of photolyases, unlike aqueous solution for the biomimetic system, provide a unique electrostatic environment and local flexibility and thus a dedicated synergy for all elementary dynamics to maximize the repair efficiency. This repair photomachine is the first enzyme that the entire functional evolution is completely mapped out in real time.},

Photosynthetic autotrophs, the base of the food web, have had to adapt physiological mechanisms to maintain growth, reproduction and metabolic activity despite environmental conditions that would shut-down cellular processes in most organisms. High latitudes are characterized by temperatures below the freezing point, complete darkness in winter and continuous light and high UV in the summer. Additionally, sea-ice, an ecological niche exploited by microbes during the long winter seasons when the ocean and land freezes over, is characterized by large salinity fluctuations, limited gas exchange, and highly oxic conditions. The last decade has been an exciting period of insights into the molecular mechanisms behind adaptation of microalgae to the cryosphere facilitated by the advancement of new scientific tools, particularly ``omics'' techniques. We review recent insights derived from genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies. Genes, proteins and pathways identified from these highly adaptable polar microbes have far-reaching biotechnological applications. Furthermore, they may provide insights into life outside this planet, as well as glimpses into the past. High latitude regions also have disproportionately large inputs into global biogeochemical cycles and are the region most sensitive to climate change.},

  abstract = {A model was constructed which includes electron transport (linear and cyclic and Mehler type reaction) coupled to proton translocation, counter ion movement, ATP synthesis, and Calvin-Benson cycle. The focus is on modeling of the light-induced total electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}) which in this model originates from the bulk phase electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}b), the localized electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}c), as well as the surface electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}s). The measured dual wavelength transmittance signal ({$\Delta$}A515--560nm, electrochromic shift) was used as a proxy for experimental {$\Delta\Psi$}. The predictions for theoretical {$\Delta\Psi$} vary with assumed contribution of {$\Delta\Psi$}s, which might imply that the measured {$\Delta$}A515--560nm trace on a long time scale reflects the interplay of the {$\Delta\Psi$} components. Simulations also show that partitioning of proton motive force (pmf) to {$\Delta\Psi$}b and {$\Delta$}pH components is sensitive to the stoichiometric ratio of H+/ATP, energy barrier for ATP synthesis, ionic strength, buffer capacity and light intensity. Our model shows that high buffer capacity promotes the establishment of {$\Delta\Psi$}b, while the formation of pHi minimum is not `dissipated' but `postponed' until it reaches the same level as that for low buffer capacity. Under physiologically optimal conditions, the output of the model shows that at steady state in light, the {$\Delta$}pH component is the main contributor to pmf to drive ATP synthesis while a low {$\Delta\Psi$}b persists energizing the membrane. Our model predicts 11mV as the resting electric potential difference across the thylakoid membrane in dark. We suggest that the model presented in this work can be integrated as a module into a more comprehensive model of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {The photosynthesis-irradiance response (PE) curve, in which mass-specific photosynthetic rates are plotted versus irradiance, is commonly used to characterize photoacclimation. The interpretation of PE curves depends critically on the currency in which mass is expressed. Normalizing the light-limited rate to chl a yields the chl a-specific initial slope ({$\alpha$}chl). This is proportional to the light absorption coefficient (achl), the proportionality factor being the photon efficiency of photosynthesis ({$\varphi$}m). Thus, {$\alpha$}chl is the product of achl and {$\varphi$}m. In microalgae {$\alpha$}chl typically shows little ({$<$}20\%) phenotypic variability because declines of {$\varphi$}m under conditions of high-light stress are accompanied by increases of achl. The variation of {$\alpha$}chl among species is dominated by changes in achl due to differences in pigment complement and pigment packaging. In contrast to the microalgae, {$\alpha$}chl declines as irradiance increases in the cyanobacteria where phycobiliproteins dominate light absorption because of plasticity in the phycobiliprotein:chl a ratio. By definition, light-saturated photosynthesis (Pm) is limited by a factor other than the rate of light absorption. Normalizing Pm to organic carbon concentration to obtain PmC allows a direct comparison with growth rates. Within species, PmC is independent of growth irradiance. Among species, PmC covaries with the resource-saturated growth rate. The chl a:C ratio is a key physiological variable because the appropriate currencies for normalizing light-limited and light-saturated photosynthetic rates are, respectively, chl a and carbon. Typically, chl a:C is reduced to about 40\% of its maximum value at an irradiance that supports 50\% of the species-specific maximum growth rate and light-harvesting accessory pigments show similar or greater declines. In the steady state, this down-regulation of pigment content prevents microalgae and cyanobacteria from maximizing photosynthetic rates throughout the light-limited region for growth. The reason for down-regulation of light harvesting, and therefore loss of potential photosynthetic gain at moderately limiting irradiances, is unknown. However, it is clear that maximizing the rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation is not the only criterion governing photoacclimation.},

The Green Edge initiative was developed to investigate the processes controlling the primary productivity and the fate of organic matter produced during the Arctic phytoplankton spring bloom (PSB) and to determine its role in the ecosystem. Two field campaigns were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at an ice camp located on landfast sea ice southeast of Qikiqtarjuaq Island in Baffin Bay (67.4797N, 63.7895W). During both expeditions, a large suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured beneath a consolidated sea ice cover from the surface to the bottom at 360\,m depth to better understand the factors driving the PSB. Key variables such as temperature, salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured at the ice camp. Here, we present the results of a joint effort to tidy and standardize the collected data sets that will facilitate their reuse in other Arctic studies.

  abstract = {The process of photosynthesis is initiated by the capture of sunlight by a network of light-absorbing molecules (chromophores), which are also responsible for the subsequent funneling of the excitation energy to the reaction centers. Through evolution, genetic drift, and speciation, photosynthetic organisms have discovered many solutions for light harvesting. In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules. In the latter half of the article, we focus on the lightharvesting complexes of purple bacteria as a model to illustrate the present understanding of the synergetic effects leading to EET optimization of light-harvesting antenna systems while exploring the structure and function of the integral chromophores. We end this review with a brief overview of the energy-transfer dynamics and pathways in the light-harvesting antennas of various photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {The exploration of cold-adapted microalgae offers a wide range of biotechnological applications that can be used for human, animal, and environmental benefits in colder climates. Previously, when the polar marine microalga Chlamydomonas malina RCC2488 was cultivated under both nitrogen replete and depleted conditions at 8{$^\circ$}C, it accumulated lipids and carbohydrates (up to 32 and 49\%, respectively), while protein synthesis decreased (up to 15\%). We hypothesized that the cultivation temperature had a more significant impact on lipid accumulation than the nitrogen availability in C. malina. Lipid accumulation was tested at three different temperatures, 4, 8, and 15{$^\circ$}C, under nitrogen replete and depleted conditions. At 4{$^\circ$}C under the nitrogen replete condition C. malina had the maximal biomass productivity (701.6 mg L--1 day--1). At this condition, protein content was higher than lipids and carbohydrates. The lipid fraction was mainly composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the polar lipid portion, achieving the highest PUFA productivity (122.5 mg L--1 day--1). At this temperature, under nitrogen deficiency, the accumulation of carbohydrates and neutral lipids was stimulated. At 8 and 15{$^\circ$}C, under both nitrogen replete and depleted conditions, the lipid and carbohydrate content were higher than at 4{$^\circ$}C, and the nitrogen stress condition did not affect the algal biochemical composition. These results suggest that C. malina is a polar marine microalga with a favorable growth temperature at 4{$^\circ$}C and is stressed at temperatures {$\geq$}8{$^\circ$}C, which directs the metabolism to the synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates. Nevertheless, C. malina RCC2488 is a microalga suitable for PUFA production at low temperatures with biomass productivities comparable with mesophilic strains.},

We tracked changes in the cellular resource allocations and functional capacities of a polar sea-ice diatom, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, to understand acclimation processes in both darkness and during the subsequent return to light. We measured parameters at specific time-points over 3 months of darkness, and then over 6 d after a return to light. Measured parameters included cell number and size, cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas, lipid and pigment contents, concentration of key proteins of the photosynthetic system, photosynthetic parameters based on both variable fluorescence and carbon assimilation, and the level of nonphotochemical quenching. A stable functional state was reached within a few days after the transition to dark and was then maintained throughout 3 months of darkness. The dark period resulted in a decrease of lipid droplet cell quota (-6\%), chlorophyll a cell quota (-41\%) and the maximum carbon fixation rate per cell (-98\%). Return to light after 1.5 months of darkness resulted in a strong induction of nonphotochemical quenching of excitation and a fast recovery of the maximum carbon fixation rate within 1 d, followed by a rapid increase in the cell number. Return to light after 3 months of darkness showed an increase of mortality or a profound downregulation induced over longer periods of darkness.},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that photoactivated adenylate cyclase from Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) is stable and functional in human cells and can be used to raise intracellular cAMP levels by exposure to blue light. Two prior crystal structures of OaPAC in the dark state, and mutagenesis experiments, indicate that the activation mechanism involves only very small movements, but we have now succeeded in refining the structure of the light-activated protein to high resolution, showing in molecular detail the changes at the chromophore on light exposure and allowing precise comparison of the structure in the light-exposed and dark states. The differences between these structures indicate the very small but concerted shifts that trigger enzyme activity tens of {\aa}ngstroms from the chromophore., The photoactivated adenylate cyclase (PAC) from the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) detects light through a flavin chromophore within the N-terminal BLUF domain. BLUF domains have been found in a number of different light-activated proteins, but with different relative orientations. The two BLUF domains of OaPAC are found in close contact with each other, forming a coiled coil at their interface. Crystallization does not impede the activity switching of the enzyme, but flash cooling the crystals to cryogenic temperatures prevents the signature spectral changes that occur on photoactivation/deactivation. High-resolution crystallographic analysis of OaPAC in the fully activated state has been achieved by cryocooling the crystals immediately after light exposure. Comparison of the isomorphous light- and dark-state structures shows that the active site undergoes minimal changes, yet enzyme activity may increase up to 50-fold, depending on conditions. The OaPAC models will assist the development of simple, direct means to raise the cyclic AMP levels of living cells by light, and other tools for optogenetics.},

Photosynthetic rate was determined in short term (1 h) incubations at -2{$^\circ$} C over a range of irradiance from 0 to 286 {$\mu$}E{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}s-1.

Photosynthetic parameters of the ice algal community were examined over a nine day period following the addition of 4 cm of surface snow while a control area remained snow-free. A reduction of 40\% in PmB relative to the control occurred after two days of snow cover; {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, Ik, and Im were not significantly altered. Low assimilation numbers and constant standing crop size, however, suggested that the algal bloom may have already reached stationary growth phase, possibly minimizing their photoadaptive response.},

Experiments were performed under manipulated pH levels (8.0, 7.7, 7.4, and 7.1) and different temperatures (1, 5, and 8 {$^\circ$}C) to simulate changes from present to plausible future levels. Each of the 12 scenarios was run for 7 days, and a significant interaction between temperature and pH on growth was detected. By combining increased temperature and acidification, the two factors counterbalanced each other, and therefore no effect on the growth rates was found. However, the growth rates increased with elevated temperatures by {\textasciitilde} 20--50 \% depending on the strain. In addition, a general negative effect of increasing acidification on growth was observed. At pH 7.7 and 7.4, the growth response varied considerably among strains. However, a more uniform response was detected at pH 7.1 with most of the strains exhibiting reduced growth rates by 20--37 \% compared to pH 8.0. It should be emphasized that a significant interaction between temperature and pH was found, meaning that the combination of the two parameters affected growth differently than when considering one at a time. Based on these results, we anticipate that the polar diatom F. cylindrus will be unaffected by changes in temperature and pH within the range expected by the end of the century. In each simulated scenario, the variation in growth rates among the strains was larger than the variation observed due to the whole range of changes in either pH or temperature. Climate change may therefore not affect the species as such, but may lead to changes in the population structure of the species, with the strains exhibiting high phenotypic plasticity, in terms of temperature and pH tolerance towards future conditions, dominating the population.},

Fm was low when the QB binding site was occupied by PQ and high when the QB binding site was empty or occupied by a PSII herbicide. Furthermore, in mutants with impaired rates of plastoquinol reoxidation, Fm was reached rapidly during MT excitation. In PSII particles with no mobile PQ pool, Fm was virtually identical to that obtained in the presence of PSII herbicides. We have developed a model to account for the variations in maximal fluorescence yields based on the occupancy of the QB binding site. The model predicts that the variations in maximal fluorescence yields are caused by the capacity of secondary electron acceptors to reoxidize QA--.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of charge recombination of the S2QA- state in photosystem II was investigated by modifying the free energy gap between the quinone acceptor QA and the primary pheophytin acceptor Ph. This was done either by changing the midpoint potential of Ph (using mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis with a modified hydrogen bond to this cofactor), or that of QA (using different inhibitors of the QB pocket). The results show that the recombination rate is dependent on the free energy gap between Ph and QA, which confirms that the indirect recombination pathway involving formation of Ph- has a significant contribution. In the mutant with the largest free energy gap, direct electron transfer from QA- to P+ predominates. The temperature dependence of the recombination rate was investigated, showing a lower activation enthalpy in this mutant compared with the WT. The data allow the determination of the rate of the direct route and of its relative weight in the various strains. The set of currently accepted values for the midpoint potentials of the QA/QA-, Ph/Ph-, and P+/P* couples is not consistent with the relatively rapid rate of the indirect recombination pathway found here, nor with the 3\% yield of delayed fluorescence as previously estimated by de Grooth and van Gorkom (1981, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 635, 445-456). It is argued that a likely explanation is that the midpoint potentials of the two latter couples are more positive than believed due to electrostatic interactions. If such is the case, the estimation of the midpoint potential of the P+/P and S2/S1 couples must also be revised upward, with values of 1260 and 1020 mV, respectively.},

  abstract = {In the recombination process of Photosystem II (S2QA-{$\rightarrow$}S1QA) the limiting step is the electron transfer from the reduced primary acceptor pheophytin Ph- to the oxidized primary donor P+ and the rate depends on the equilibrium constant between states S2PPhQA- and S1P+Ph-QA. Accordingly, mutations that affect the midpoint potential of Ph or of P result in a modified recombination rate. A strong correlation is observed between the effects on the recombination rate and on thermoluminescence (TL, the light emission from S2QA- during a warming ramp): a slower recombination corresponds to a large enhancement and higher temperature of the TL peak. The current theory of TL does not account for these effects, because it is based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step coincides with the radiative process. When implementing the known fact that the radiative pathway represents a minor leak, the modified TL theory readily accounts qualitatively for the observed behavior. However, the peak temperature is still lower than predicted from the temperature-dependence of recombination. We argue that this reflects the heterogeneity of the recombination process combined with the enhanced sensitivity of TL to slower components. The recombination kinetics are accurately fitted as a sum of two exponentials and we show that this is not due to a progressive stabilization of the charge-separated state, but to a pre-existing conformational heterogeneity.},

Constraints on the ability to grow at very low fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation fall into three categories. Category one includes essential processes whose efficiency is independent of the rate of energy input, but whose catalysts show phylogenetic variation leading to different energy costs for a given process in different taxa, e.g. light-harvesting complexes, RUBISCO and probably in the sensitivity of PsII to photodamage. The second category comprises essential processes whose efficiency decreases with decreasing energy input rate as a result of back-reactions independent of the energy input rate, e.g. charge recombination following charge separation by PsII and short-circuit H+ fluxes across the thylakoid membrane which decrease the fraction of pumped H+ which can be used in adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation. Category two also includes that component of protein turnover which cannot be related to replacement of polypeptides which were incorrectly assembled following uncorrected errors of transcription or translation, or which were damaged by processes whose rate increases with increasing energy input rate such as photodamage to PsII. The third category includes only O2-dependent damage to the D1 protein of PsII whose rate increases with a decreasing incident flux of photosynthetically active radiation. Processes in categories two and three are most likely to impose the lower limit on the photon flux density which can support photolithotrophic growth. The available literature, mainly on organisms which are not adapted to growth at very low photon flux densities, suggests that three major limitations (charge recombination in PsII, H+ leakage and slippage, and protein turnover) can individually impose lower limits in excess of 20\hspace{0.166em}nmol photon m-2\hspace{0.166em}s-1 on photolithotrophic growth. Furthermore, these three limitations are interactive, so that considering all three processes acting in series leads to an even higher predicted lower photon flux density limit for photolithotrophic growth.},

Although there is some variability within each class, dinoflagellates and blue-green algae generally photosynthesize and grow best at low photon flux densities. Diatoms also tend to be able to grow at very low photon flux densities (growth for some species has been reported at less than 1 {$\mu$}E m-1 s-2). Comparison of the photon flux densities at which photoinhibition occurs in dainoflagellates and diatoms suggests that the former often experience photoinhibition at comparatively low irradiances. In contrast, diatoms often can tolerate relatively high light environments. This tolerance of a large absolute range of photon flux densities may, in part, explain why diatoms are often associated with spring blooms. Green algae},

We distinguish between uncoupling by proton slip, which means a decrease of the H+/e--ratio due to less efficient proton pumping, and proton leak as defined by enhanced kinetics of proton efflux. Proton slip and proton leak made about equal contributions to the total uncoupling. The enhanced proton efflux kinetics corresponded to reduction of subunit CF1-{$\gamma$} of the ATP synthase as shown by fluorescence labeling of thylakoid proteins with the sulfhydryl probe 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein. The maximum value of the fraction of reduced CF1-{$\gamma$} was only 36\%, which indicates that in vivo the reduction of CF1-{$\gamma$} could be limited by fast reoxidation and/or restricted accessibility of CF1-{$\gamma$} to thioredoxin. Measurements of the ratio ATP/2e indicated that only the uncoupling related to less efficient proton pumping led to a decrease in the ATP yield.},

  abstract = {Microalgal pigment composition, photosynthetic characteristics, single-cell absorption efficiency (Qa({$\lambda$})) spectra, and fluorescence-excitation (FE) spectra were determined for platelet ice and benthic communities underlying fast ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, during austral spring 1988. Measurements of spectral irradiance (E({$\lambda$})) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as samples for particulate absorption measurements were taken directly under the congelation ice, within the platelet layer, as profiles vertically through the water column, and at the benihic surface. Light attenuation by.sea ice, algal pigments, and particulates reduced PAR reaching the platelet ice layer to 3\%(9--33 fimol photons m-2--s-1) of surface values and narrowed its spectral distribution to a band between 400 and 580 nm. Attenuation by the water column further reduced PAR reaching the sea floor (28--m depth) to 0.05\% of surface levels ({$<$} 1 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1), with a spectral distribution dominated by 470--580--nm wavelengths. The photoadaptive index (I) for platelet ice algae (5.9--12.6 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2.s-1) was similar to ambient PAR, indicating that algae had acclimated to their light environment (i.e. the algae were light-replete). Maximum Qa({$\lambda$}) at the blue absorption peak (440 nm) was 0.63, and enhanced absorption was observed from 460--500 nm and was consistent with observed high cellular chlorophyll (chi) c:chl a and fucoxanthin: chl a molar ratios (0.4 and 1.2, respectively). Benthic algae were light-limited despite the maintenance of very low Ik values (4--11 {$\mu$}mol photons.m-2.s-1). Extremely high fucoxanthin: chi a ratios (1.6) in benthic algae produced enhanced green light absorption, resulting in a high degree of complementation between algal absorption and ambient spectral irradiance. Qa({$\lambda$}) values for benthic algae were maximal (0.9) between 400 and 510 nm but remained {$>$}0.35 even at absorption minima. Strong spectral flattening, a characteristic of intense pigment packaging, was also apparent in the Qa({$\lambda$}) spectra for benthic algae. FE and Qa({$\lambda$}) spectra were similar in shape for platelet ice algae, indicating that the efficiency at which absorbed energy was transferred to photosystem II (PSII) was independent of wavelength. Fluorescence emission by benthic algae was greatest for the 500--560--nm excitation wavelengths, suggesting that most energy absorbed by accessory pigments was transferred to PSII. These results suggest that under ice algae employ complementary pigmentation and maximize absorption efficiency as adaptive strategies to low-light stress. Regulating the distribution of absorbed energy between PSI and PSII may be an adaptive response to the restricted spectral distribution of irradiance.},

  abstract = {Iron limitation is the major factor controlling phytoplankton growth in vast regions of the contemporary oceans. In this study, a combination of thermoluminescence (TL), chlorophyll fluorescence, and P700 absorbance measurements have been used to elucidate the effects of iron deficiency in the photosynthetic electron transport of the marine diatom P. tricornutum. TL was used to determine the effects of iron deficiency on photosystem II (PSII) activity. Excitation of iron-replete P. tricornutum cells with single turn-over flashes induced the appearance of TL glow curves with two components with different peaks of temperature and contributions to the total signal intensity: the B band (23{$^\circ$}C, 63\%), and the AG band (40{$^\circ$}C, 37\%). Iron limitation did not significantly alter these bands, but induced a decrease of the total TL signal. Far red excitation did not increase the amount of the AG band in iron-limited cells, as observed for iron-replete cells. The effect of iron deficiency on the photosystem I (PSI) activity was also examined by measuring the changes in P700 redox state during illumination. The electron donation to PSI was substantially reduced in iron-deficient cells. This could be related with the important decline on cytochrome c6 content observed in these cells. Iron deficiency also induced a marked increase in light sensitivity in P. tricornutum cells. A drastic increase in the level of peroxidation of chloroplast lipids was detected in iron-deficient cells even when grown under standard conditions at low light intensity. Illumination with a light intensity of 300 {$\mu$}E m-2 s-1 during different time periods caused a dramatic disappearance in TL signal in cells grown under low iron concentration, this treatment not affecting to the signal in iron-replete cells. The results of this work suggest that iron deficiency induces partial blocking of the electron transfer between PSII and PSI, due to a lower concentration of the electron donor cytochrome c6. This decreased electron transfer may induce the over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool and consequently the appearance of acceptor side photoinhibition in PSII even at low light intensities. The functionality of chlororespiratory electron transfer pathway under iron restricted conditions is also discussed.},

  abstract = {The energy-converting redox enzymes perform productive reactions efficiently despite the involvement of high energy intermediates in their catalytic cycles. This is achieved by kinetic control: with forward reactions being faster than competing, energy-wasteful reactions. This requires appropriate cofactor spacing, driving forces and reorganizational energies. These features evolved in ancestral enzymes in a low O2 environment. When O2 appeared, energy-converting enzymes had to deal with its troublesome chemistry. Various protective mechanisms duly evolved that are not directly related to the enzymes' principal redox roles. These protective mechanisms involve fine-tuning of reduction potentials, switching of pathways and the use of short circuits, back-reactions and side-paths, all of which compromise efficiency. This energetic loss is worth it since it minimises damage from reactive derivatives of O2 and thus gives the organism a better chance of survival. We examine photosynthetic reaction centres, bc 1 and b 6 f complexes from this view point. In particular, the evolution of the heterodimeric PSI from its homodimeric ancestors is explained as providing a protective back-reaction pathway. This ``sacrifice-of-efficiency-for-protection'' concept should be generally applicable to bioenergetic enzymes in aerobic environments.},

Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in the development and application of ST-ChlF methods in aquatic ecosystems, and in the interpretation of the resulting observations. At the same time, however, an increasing number of sensor types, sampling protocols, and data processing algorithms have created confusion and uncertainty among potential users, with a growing divergence of practice among different research groups. In this review, we assist the existing and upcoming user community by providing an overview of current approaches and consensus recommendations for the use of ST-ChlF measurements to examine in-situ phytoplankton productivity and photo-physiology. We argue that a consistency of practice and adherence to basic operational and quality control standards is critical to ensuring data inter-comparability. Large datasets of inter-comparable and globally coherent ST-ChlF observations hold the potential to reveal large-scale patterns and trends in phytoplankton photo-physiology, photosynthetic rates and bottom-up controls on primary productivity. As such, they hold great potential to provide invaluable physiological observations on the scales relevant for the development and validation of ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms.},

Fluctuating light regimes simulated regular vertical mixing in lakes with a ratio of euphotic to mixed depth (zeu : zmix) of 1 and 0.5 on a cloudless day. Light fluctuations at zeu : zmix = 1 decreased the growth rates of S. minutulus, N. acicularis, and L. redekei by 18\%, 33\%, and 29\%, respectively, compared to constant light at the same daily light supply. Temperature had no effect on this decrease. Halving zeu : zmix (simulating deep mixing) had the same effect on growth as halving the photoperiod, demonstrating that these factors are cumulative. We introduce a simple empirical factor to adjust growth rates measured under constant light to account for fluctuating light. This factor is independent of temperature and photoperiod, applies over a range of zeu : zmix, and accurately describes present and published growth rates of several species. We show how to account for temporal variability of the light supply at different temperatures and photoperiods when predicting growth rates of phytoplankton.},

  abstract = {Under environmental stress, plants and algae employ a variety of strategies to protect the photosynthetic apparatus and maintain photostasis. To date, most studies on stress acclimation have focused on model organisms which possess limited to no tolerance to stressful extremes. We studied the ability of the Antarctic alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO 241 (UWO 241) to acclimate to low temperature, high salinity or high light. UWO 241 maintained robust growth and photosynthetic activity at levels of temperature (2~{$^\circ$}C) and salinity (700~mM NaCl) which were nonpermissive for a mesophilic sister species, Chlamydomonas raudensis SAG 49.72 (SAG 49.72). Acclimation in the mesophile involved classic mechanisms, including downregulation of light harvesting and shifts in excitation energy between photosystem I and II. In contrast, UWO 241 exhibited high rates of PSI-driven cyclic electron flow (CEF) and a larger capacity for nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Furthermore, UWO 241 exhibited constitutively high activity of two key ascorbate cycle enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase and maintained a large ascorbate pool. These results matched the ability of the psychrophile to maintain low ROS under short-term photoinhibition conditions. We conclude that tight control over photostasis and ROS levels are essential for photosynthetic life to flourish in a native habitat of permanent photooxidative stress.~We propose to rename this organism Chlamydomonas priscuii.},

  abstract = {Significance             Controls on phytoplankton productivity in the extreme environment of the Southern Ocean has received widespread attention. This polar region presents three challenges to primary producers: how to subsist under the joint constraints of low temperatures, low light, and growth-limiting concentrations of the essential trace element iron. The resident phytoplankton have overcome these extreme environmental conditions with a unique combination of physiological adaptations. They have modified parts of their photosynthetic machinery to harvest low levels of light without substantially increasing their iron requirements, and in a way that may exploit the low temperature in their environment. Together, these adaptations enable them to use iron and light more efficiently and grow faster than environmental conditions should otherwise permit.           ,                             Phytoplankton productivity in the polar Southern Ocean (SO) plays an important role in the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean's interior, a process called the biological carbon pump, which helps regulate global climate. SO productivity in turn is limited by low iron, light, and temperature, which restrict the efficiency of the carbon pump. Iron and light can colimit productivity due to the high iron content of the photosynthetic photosystems and the need for increased photosystems for low-light acclimation in many phytoplankton. Here we show that SO phytoplankton have evolved critical adaptations to enhance photosynthetic rates under the joint constraints of low iron, light, and temperature. Under growth-limiting iron and light levels, three SO species had up to sixfold higher photosynthetic rates per photosystem II and similar or higher rates per mol of photosynthetic iron than temperate species, despite their lower growth temperature (3 vs. 18 {$^\circ$}C) and light intensity (30 vs. 40 {$\mu$}mol quanta{$\cdot$}m               2               {$\cdot$}s               -1               ), which should have decreased photosynthetic rates. These unexpectedly high rates in the SO species are partly explained by their unusually large photosynthetic antennae, which are among the largest ever recorded in marine phytoplankton. Large antennae are disadvantageous at low light intensities because they increase excitation energy loss as heat, but this loss may be mitigated by the low SO temperatures. Such adaptations point to higher SO production rates than environmental conditions should otherwise permit, with implications for regional ecology and biogeochemistry.},

Both assimilation numbers at saturating light levels and the slopes of the light-limited portions of the photosynthesis versus irradiance curves were smaller than in algae from lower latitudes. However, both parameters increased significantly with rising temperatures. Light-saturated photosynthesis on the average exhibited a Q10-value of ca. 4.2 between-1.5{$^\circ$}C and +2{$^\circ$}C. Light-limited photosynthesis between-1.5{$^\circ$}C and +5{$^\circ$}C rose at a rate corresponding to a Q10-value of roughly 2.6. Above +5{$^\circ$}C, temperature enhancement of both light-saturated and light-limited photosynthetic rates was minimal or absent. Our results suggest that under extremely low temperatures light-limited photosynthetic rates become temperature-dependent due to changes in maximum quantum yields.},

In this study, we assess the ability of a sea ice diatom (Fragilariopsis cylindrus) to cope with physicochemical changes through examination of physiological status and allocation of 14C-incorporated organic carbon into particulate and extracellular fractions, using closed-bottle incubations over 49d. Carbon allocation was found to vary with growth stage and shifts in the physicochemical environment, in particular the carbonate system. Total extracellular organic carbon was comprised of at least 85\% low molecular weight 14C-colloidal-organic carbon. The relative contribution of 14C-extracellular polymeric substances and 14C-total extracellular organic carbon to 14C-total primary production varied from lag to senescent growth phases, increasing from 0 to 5.7\% and 32.9\% to 69.5\%, respectively. Carbon allocation into 14C-extracellular polymeric substances was correlated with a decline in CO2 availability and increased pH. Overall, the results demonstrate that carbon exudation may play an important role in adaptive algal physiology by buffering cells against biogeochemical shifts within brine channels, induced through photosynthetic activity.},

Second, photoprotection is provided by competition between 3[P680+Phe-] formation and direct recombination of the 1[P680+Phe-] and P680+QA- states. The efficiency of these two pathways is under control of the redox potential of the Phe and QA electron acceptors, which is utilized during adaptation to high light conditions.},

  abstract = {The effects of PAR and UV radiation on PS II photochemistry were examined in natural phytoplankton communities from coastal waters off Rhode Island (USA) and the subtropical Pacific. The photochemical energy conversion efficiency, the functional absorption cross section and the kinetics of electron transfer on the acceptor side of PS II were derived from variable fluorescence parameters using both pump and probe and fast repetition rate techniques. In both environments, the natural phytoplankton communities displayed marked decreases in PS II photochemical energy conversion efficiency that were correlated with increased PAR. In the coastal waters, the changes in photochemical energy conversion efficiency were not statistically different for samples treated with supplementary UV-B radiation or screened to exclude ambient UV-B. Moreover, no significant light-dependent changes in the functional absorption cross section of PS II were observed. The rate of electron transfer between QA- and QB was, however, slightly reduced in photodamaged cells, indicative of damage on the acceptor side. In the subtropical Pacific, the decrease in photochemical energy conversion efficiency was significantly greater for samples exposed to natural levels of UV-A and/or UV-B compared with those exposed to PAR alone. The cells displayed large diurnal changes in the functional absorption cross section of PS II, indicative of non-photochemical quenching in the antenna. The changes in the functional absorption cross section were highly correlated with PAR but independent of UV radiation. The time course of changes in photochemical efficiency reveals that the photoinhibited reaction centers rapidly recover (within an hour or two) to their preillumination values. Thus, while we found definitive evidence for photoinhibition of PS II photochemistry in both coastal and open ocean phytoplankton communities, we did not find any effect of UV-B on the former, but a clear effect on the latter. The results of this study indicate that the effects of UV-B radiation on phytoplankton photosynthesis are as dependent on the radiative transfer properties of the water body and the mixing rate, as on the wavelength and energy distribution of the radiation and the absorption cross sections of the biophysical targets.},

Classical uniform scaling applied to phytoplankton maximum growth rate ({$\mu$}max), however, meets several theoretical and empirical limitations. As an alternative model, I propose a non-uniform size dependency of {$\mu$}max by considering how the geometry of unicells determines photosynthetic capacity. The model starts from physical laws of absorption and diffusion and uses known biochemical or biophysical coefficients. Calculated intracellular light and CO2 levels decline from the membrane to the cell centre, which may depress photosynthesis even under optimal growth conditions. Combination of the depletion model with a mechanistically motivated scaling rule for respiration generates a uni-modal size function for {$\mu$}max. The function greatly improves predictions of classical allometries, in particular, for small cells and across taxonomic groups. Uni-modality in {$\mu$}max has various implications for phytoplankton eco-physiology and morphology, correctly describing the absence of very small diatoms or giant green algae. For larger size classes, an increased benefit of non-spherical forms or of elevated pCO2 is calculated, whereas the advantage of carbon concentrating mechanisms turns out to be maximal for intermediate sizes. The model also points to a high degree of co-adaptation in different uptake systems.},

Here, we highlight studies revealing how vitamin B12 (cobalamin)-producing bacteria increase the fitness of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii following an increase in environmental temperature. Heat stress represses C. reinhardtii cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (METE) gene expression coinciding with a reduction in METE-mediated methionine synthase activity, chlorosis and cell death during heat stress. However, in the presence of cobalamin-producing bacteria or exogenous cobalamin amendments C. reinhardtii cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase METH-mediated methionine biosynthesis is functional at temperatures that result in C. reinhardtii death in the absence of cobalamin. Artificial microRNA silencing of C. reinhardtii METH expression leads to nearly complete loss of cobalamin-mediated enhancement of thermal tolerance. This suggests that methionine biosynthesis is an essential cellular mechanism for adaptation by C. reinhardtii to thermal stress. Increased fitness advantage of METH under environmentally stressful conditions could explain the selective pressure for retaining the METH gene in algae and the apparent independent loss of the METE gene in various algal species. Our results show that how an organism acclimates to a change in its abiotic environment depends critically on co-occurring species, the nature of that interaction, and how those species interactions evolve.},

  abstract = {Understanding energetic and kinetic parameters of intermediates formed in the course of the reaction cycle (S-state cycle) of photosynthetic water oxidation is of high interest and could support the rationale designs of artificial systems for solar fuels. We use time-resolved measurements of the delayed chlorophyll fluorescence to estimate rate constants, activation energies, free energy differences, and to discriminate between the enthalpic and the entropic contributions to the decrease of the Gibbs free energy of the individual transitions. Using a joint-fit simulation approach, kinetic parameters are determined for the reaction intermediates in the S-state transitions in buffers with different pH in H2O and in D2O.},
