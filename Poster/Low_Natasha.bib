This Review addresses four major complementary questions of ongoing Arctic Ocean changes and associated impacts on phytoplankton productivity, phenology and assemblage composition. We highlight trends in primary production over the last two decades while considering how multiple environmental drivers shape Arctic biogeography. Further, we consider changes to Arctic phenology by borealization and hidden under-ice blooms, and how the diversity of phytoplankton assemblages might evolve in a novel Arctic `biogeochemical landscape'. It is critical to understand these aspects of changing Arctic phytoplankton dynamics as they exert pressure on marine Arctic ecosystems in addition to direct effects from rapid environmental changes.},

  abstract = {Precautionary conservation and cooperative global governance are needed to protect Antarctic blue carbon: the world's largest increasing natural form of carbon storage with high sequestration potential. As patterns of ice loss around Antarctica become more uniform, there is an underlying increase in carbon capture-to-storage-to-sequestration on the seafloor. The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1{\textdegree}C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1{\textdegree}C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs). In contrast, on the basis of past change and current research, we expect that Antarctic blue carbon could increase by orders of magnitude. The Antarctic seafloor is biophysically unique and the site of carbon sequestration, the benthos, faces less anthropogenic disturbance than any other ocean continental shelf environment. This isolation imparts both vulnerability to change, and an avenue to conserve one of the world's last biodiversity refuges. In economic terms, the value of Antarctic blue carbon is estimated at between {\textsterling}0.65 and {\textsterling}1.76~billion ({\textasciitilde}2.27~billion USD) for sequestered carbon in the benthos around the continental shelf. To balance biodiversity protection against society's economic objectives, this paper builds on a proposal incentivising protection by building a 'non-market framework' via the 2015 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This could be connected and coordinated through the Antarctic Treaty System to promote and motivate member states to value Antarctic blue carbon and maintain scientific integrity and conservation for the positive societal values ingrained in the Antarctic Treaty System.},

Recently, a multigene family of AFP genes was found in the diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, a dominant species within polar sea ice assemblages. This study presents the AFP from F. cylindrus set in a molecular and crystallographic frame. Differential protein expression after exposure of the diatoms to environmentally relevant conditions underlined the importance of certain AFP isoforms in response to cold. Analyses of the recombinant AFP showed freezing point depression comparable to the activity of other moderate AFPs and further enhanced by salt (up to 0.9{\textdegree}C in low salinity buffer, 2.5{\textdegree}C at high salinity). However, unlike other moderate AFPs, its fastest growth direction is perpendicular to the c-axis. The protein also caused strong inhibition of recrystallization at concentrations of 1.2 and 0.12{$\mu$}M at low and high salinity, respectively. Observations of crystal habit modifications and pitting activity suggested binding of AFPs to multiple faces of the ice crystals. Further analyses showed striations caused by AFPs, interpreted as inclusion in the ice. We suggest that the influence on ice microstructure is the main characteristic of these AFPs in sea ice.},

First, the polar night is not a period void of biological activity even though primary production is close to zero, but is rather characterized by a number of processes and interactions yet to be fully understood, including unanticipated high levels of feeding and reproduction in a wide range of taxa and habitats. Second, as more knowledge emerges, it is evident that a coupled physical and biological perspective of the ecosystem will redefine seasonality beyond the ``calendar perspective''. Third, it appears that many organisms may exhibit endogenous rhythms that trigger fitness-maximizing activities in the absence of light-based cues. Indeed a common adaptation appears to be the ability to utilize the dark season for reproduction. This and other processes are most likely adaptations to current environmental conditions and community and trophic structures of the ecosystem, and may have implications for how Arctic ecosystems can change under continued climatic warming.},

How Arctic diatom photoadaptation strategies differ across their heterogeneous light niches remains a poorly documented but crucial missing link to anticipate Arctic Ocean responses to shrinking sea-ice and increasing light. To address this question, we selected five Arctic diatom species with diverse life traits, representative of distinct light niches across the seasonal light environment continuum: from snow-covered dimly lit bottom ice to summer stratified waters. We studied their photoacclimation plasticity to two growth light levels and the subsequent responses of their nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and xanthophyll cycle to both dark incubations and light shifts. We deciphered NPQ and xanthophyll cycle tuning in darkness and their light-dependent induction kinetics, which aligned with species' light niche occupancy. In ice-related species, NPQ was sustained in darkness and its induction was more reactive to moderate light shifts. Open-water species triggered strong NPQ induction in darkness and reached higher maximal NPQ under high light. Marginal ice zone species showed strong adaptation to light fluctuations with a dark response fine-tuned depending upon light history. We argue these traits are anchored in diverging photoadaption strategies fostering Arctic diatom success in their respective light niches.},

Many cold-water algae are psychrophiles that thrive in the cold but cannot grow at moderate temperatures ({$\geq$}20{\textdegree}C). Polar regions are at risk of rapid warming caused by climate change, and the sensitivity of psychrophilic algae to rising temperatures makes them, and the ecosystems they inhabit, particularly vulnerable. Recent research on the Antarctic psychrophile Chlamydomonas priscuii, an emerging algal model, has revealed unique adaptations to life in the permanent cold. Additionally, genome sequencing of C. priscuii and its relative Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L has given rise to a plethora of computational tools that can help elucidate the genetic basis of psychrophily. This minireview summarizes new advances in characterizing the heat stress responses in psychrophilic algae and examines their extraordinary sensitivity to temperature increases. Further research in this field will help determine the impact of climate change on psychrophiles from threatened polar environments.},

The photons can be provided successively by applying short flashes of light. Already in 1970, Kok and coworkers [Photochem Photobiol 11:457{\textendash}475, 1970] developed a basic model to explain the flash-number dependence of O2 formation. The third flash applied to dark-adapted PSII induces the S3{\textrightarrow}S4{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition, which is coupled to dioxygen formation at a protein-bound Mn4Ca complex. The sequence of events leading to dioxygen formation and the role of Kok's enigmatic S4-state are only incompletely understood. Recently we have shown by time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy that in the S3{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition an interesting intermediate is formed, prior to the onset of O{\textendash}O bond formation [Haumann et~al. Science 310:1019{\textendash}1021, 2005]. The experimental results of the time-resolved X-ray experiments are discussed. The identity of the reaction intermediate is considered and the question is addressed how the novel intermediate is related to the S4-state proposed in 1970 by Bessel Kok. This leads us to an extension of the classical S-state cycle towards a basic model which describes sequence and interplay of electron and proton abstraction events at the donor side of PSII [Dau and Haumann, Science 312:1471{\textendash}1472, 2006].},

The damping is attributed to `misses' resulting from a statistical probability that a reaction center fails to produce a stable charge separation after a saturating flash. The origin of misses is of interest because its probable dependence on flash number, in principle, affects the quantitative interpretation of all measurements on phenomena associated with the period four oscillation. We show that the kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence yield transients induced by a flash series can be used to estimate the relative amplitudes of the miss probability on each flash. It is concluded that a major part of the misses must be caused by failure of the reduction of the oxidized primary electron donor chlorophyll P680+ by the secondary donor tyrosine YZ before the charge separation is lost by recombination. The probability of this failure is found to increase with the oxidation state of the oxygen-evolving complex: more than half of it occurs upon charge separation in the S3 state, which is attributed to the presence of YZox S2 in Boltzmann equilibrium with YZS3.},

They are able to acclimate to fast changes in the light intensity by various mechanisms including a rise in non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ). The latter has been attributed to the xanthophyll cycle (XC) following activation of diadinoxanthin de-epoxidase by the acidification of the thylakoid lumen. To examine whether fluorescence quenching in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum depends on the {$\Delta$}pH generated by the photosynthetic electron transport, we arrested the latter by 3-(3{${'}$},4{${'}$}-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). This treatment hardly affected the NPQ or XC, even when methylviologen was present. Dissipation of the {$\Delta$}pH by 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited the XC but did not alter NPQ. Similar results, i.e. inhibition of the XC but normal fluorescence quenching, were observed when the experiments were performed at 3{\textdegree}C. Measurements of thermoluminescence showed that excess light treatment caused a marked decline in the signals obtained as a result of recombination of QB- with the S3 state of the Mn cluster; this was also observed in cells treated with DCMU (recombination of QA- with S2). Light treatment also diminished the QA- re-oxidation signals. The data suggest that changes in PSII core centre itself due to exposure to excess light conditions play an important part in the acclimation of P. tricornutum to the changing light conditions.},

Onset of the spring bloom of ice algae is typically limited by the availability of light, and the current consensus is that a few tens-of-centimeters of snow is enough to prevent sufficient solar radiation to reach underneath the sea ice. We challenge this consensus, and investigated the onset and the light requirement of an ice algae spring bloom, and the importance of snow optical properties for light penetration. Colonization by ice algae began in May under {$>$}1 m of first-year sea ice with {$\sim$}1 m thick snow cover on top, in NE Greenland. The initial growth of ice algae began at extremely low irradiance ({$<$}0.17 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1) and was documented as an increase in Chlorophyll a concentration, an increase in algal cell number, and a viable photosynthetic activity. Snow thickness changed little during May (from 110 to 91 cm), however the snow temperature increased steadily, as observed from automated high-frequency temperature profiles. We propose that changes in snow optical properties, caused by temperature-driven snow metamorphosis, was the primary driver for allowing sufficient light to penetrate through the thick snow and initiate algae growth below the sea ice. This was supported by radiative-transfer modeling of light attenuation. Implications are an earlier productivity by ice algae in Arctic sea ice than recognized previously.},

Hence, this photoprotective mechanism is called reaction center quenching. One technique to assess reaction center quenching is photosynthetic thermoluminescence. This technique represents a simple but powerful probe of PS II photochemistry that measures the light emitted due to the reversal of PS II charge separation through the thermally-dependent recombination of the negative charges stabilized on Q-A and Q-B on the acceptor side of PS II with the positive charges accumulated in the S2- and S3-states of the oxygen evolving complex. Changes in the temperature maxima for photosynthetic thermoluminescence may reflect changes in redox potentials of recombining species within PS II reaction centers. Exposure of Synechococcussp. PCC 7942, Pinus sylvestrisL., Arabidopsis thaliana, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to either lowtemperatures or to high light induces a significant downshift in the temperature maxima for S2Q-B and S3Q-B recombinations relative to S2Q-A and S3Q-A recombinations. These shifts in recombination temperatures are indicative of lower activation energy for the S2Q-B redox pair recombination and a narrowing of the free energy gap betweenQAandQB electron acceptors. This, in turn, is associated with a decrease in the overall thermoluminescence emission. We propose that environmental factors such as high light and low temperature result in an increased population of reduced QA (Q-A), that is, increased excitation pressure, facilitating non-radiative P680+Q-A radical pair recombination within the PS II reaction center. The underlying molecular mechanisms regulating reaction center quenching appear to be species dependent. We conclude that reaction center quenching and antenna quenching are complementary mechanisms that may function to photoprotect PS II to different extents in vivo depending on the species as well as the environmental conditions to which the organism is exposed.},

  abstract = {Acclimation, adaptation and survival in persistent cold polar environments are complex phenomena associated with myriad molecular, biochemical and physiological mechanisms. The psychrophile, Chlamydomonas priscuii, is endemic to Lake Bonney, Antarctica. Adaptation to its extreme polar environment includes homeoviscous adaptation of membranes, maintenance of energy balance through photostasis and surface area to volume ratio. In addition to these mechanisms, this psychrophile can exist in culture as motile, single cells or as immobile, multicellular palmelloids. Comparative biochemical, physiological, microscopic and spectroscopic analyses of purified single cells and palmelloids indicate that the conversion of single cells to multicellular palmelloids alters the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus. This enhances photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus from light and low temperature stress by minimizing potential cellular energy imbalances and safely dissipating excessive excitation energy by nonphotochemical quenching mechanisms. In addition to decreased susceptibility to predation, enhanced photoprotection from photoinhibition associated with palmelloid formation may be a complementary, selective, evolutionary advantage for the induction of multicellularity in green algae.},

The PSII core complex from cyanobacteria consists of 17 transmembrane subunits and 3 extrinsic subunits with a total molecular mass of approximately 350 kDa per monomer, and PSII exists predominately in a dimeric form in vivo. This chapter describes the purification procedures leading to highly pure, homogenous, and highly active PSII core dimers from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (T. vulcanus), that are used for successful crystallization and diffraction at atomic resolution. The purity and homogeneity of the PSII dimers thus obtained are characterized by absorption spectra, low-temperature fluorescence spectra, SDS-PAGE, clear native PAGE, blue native PAGE, gel filtration chromatography, and oxygen-evolving activity measurements. Finally, high-quality crystals obtained from the purified PSII dimers are shown.},

The ability of Antarctic sea-ice diatoms to survive this prolonged darkness relies on their metabolic capability. This study is the first to examine the proteome of a prominent sea-ice diatom in response to extended darkness, focusing on the protein-level mechanisms of dark survival. The Antarctic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus was grown under continuous light or darkness for 120 d. The whole cell proteome was quantitatively analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS to investigate metabolic changes that occur during sustained darkness and during recovery under illumination. Enzymes of metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in respiratory processes, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the urea cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain became more abundant in the dark. Within the plastid, carbon fixation halted while the upper sections of the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathways became less active. We have discovered how F. cylindrus utilises an ancient alternative metabolic mechanism that enables its capacity for long-term dark survival. By sustaining essential metabolic processes in the dark, F. cylindrus retains the functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus, ensuring rapid recovery upon re-illumination.},

Despite numerous studies on overwintering strategies, such as utilization of stored energy products, formation of resting stages, reduction of metabolic rates and heterotrophic lifestyles, there have been few attempts to assess the in situ physiological state and restoration of the photosynthetic apparatus upon re-illumination. In this study, we found diverse and active marine phytoplankton communities during the polar night at 78{\textdegree}N. Furthermore, we observed rapid changes ({$\leq$}20 min) in the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport upon re-illumination. High photosynthetic capacity and net primary production were established after 24 h of re-illumination. Our results suggest that some Arctic autotrophs maintain fully functional photosystem II and downstream electron acceptors during the polar night even though the low in situ net primary production levels measured in January prove that light was not sufficient to support any measurable primary production. Due to low temperatures resulting in low respiratory rates as well as the absence of photodamage during the polar night, maintenance of basic photosynthetic machinery may actually pose relatively low metabolic costs for algal cells. This could allow Arctic microalgae to endure the polar night without the formation of dormant stages, enabling them to recover and take advantage of light immediately upon the suns return during the winter{\textendash}spring transition.},

  abstract = {Plants are often exposed to external conditions that adversely affect their growth, development or productivity. Such unfavourable environmental stress factors may result in rapid and transient increases of intracellular concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are chemically distinct and impact plants either by being cytotoxic or by acting as a signal. Because different ROS are generated simultaneously in different cellular and extracellular compartments, it is almost impossible to link a particular ROS to a specific stress response and to determine its mode of action. The conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis has been used to determine the biological role of singlet oxygen. Immediately after a dark/light shift of the flu mutant, singlet oxygen is generated within the plastids activating several stress responses that include growth inhibition of mature plants and seedling lethality. These stress responses do not result from physicochemical damage caused by singlet oxygen, but are attributable to the activation of a genetically determined stress response programme triggered by the Executer1 protein. Singlet oxygen-mediated stress responses at the transcriptional level necessitate a retrograde transduction of signals from the chloroplast to the nucleus that activate distinct sets of genes different from those that are induced by superoxide/hydrogen peroxide. Hence, the biological activities of these two types of ROS are distinct from each other. Whether they act independently or interact is not known yet and is the topic of our current research.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems at high latitudes are characterized by extreme seasonal changes in light conditions, as well as a limited period of high primary production during spring and early summer. As light returns at the end of winter to Arctic ice-covered seas, a first algal bloom takes place in the bottom layer of the sea ice. This bottom ice algae community develops through three distinct phases in the transition from winter to spring, starting with phase I, a predominantly net heterotroph community that has limited interaction with the pelagic or benthic realms. Phase II begins in the spring once light for photosynthesis becomes available at the ice bottom, although interaction with the water column and benthos remains limited. The transition to the final phase III is then mainly driven by a balance of atmospheric and oceanographic forcing that induce structural changes in the sea ice and ultimately the removal of algal biomass from the ice. Due to limited data availability an incomplete understanding exists of all the processes determining ice algal bloom phenology and the considerable geographic differences in sympagic algal standing stocks and primary production. We present here the first pan-Arctic compilation of available time-series data on vernal sea ice algal bloom development and identify the most important factors controlling its development and termination. Using data from the area surrounding Resolute Bay (Nunavut, Canada) as an example, we support previous investigations that snow cover on top of the ice influences sea ice algal phenology, with highest biomass development, but also earliest termination of blooms, under low snow cover. We also provide a pan-Arctic overview of sea ice algae standing stocks and primary production, and discuss the pertinent processes behind the geographic differences we observed. Finally, we assess potential future changes in vernal algal bloom phenology as a consequence of climate change, including their importance to different groups of grazers.},

To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low-light, high-nutrient, ice-covered spring and the high-light, low-nutrient, ice-free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become ``primed'' for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.},

The Green Edge initiative was developed to investigate the processes controlling the primary productivity and the fate of organic matter produced during the Arctic phytoplankton spring bloom (PSB) and to determine its role in the ecosystem. Two field campaigns were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at an ice camp located on landfast sea ice southeast of Qikiqtarjuaq Island in Baffin Bay (67.4797N, 63.7895W). During both expeditions, a large suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured beneath a consolidated sea ice cover from the surface to the bottom at 360\,m depth to better understand the factors driving the PSB. Key variables such as temperature, salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured at the ice camp. Here, we present the results of a joint effort to tidy and standardize the collected data sets that will facilitate their reuse in other Arctic studies.

We tracked changes in the cellular resource allocations and functional capacities of a polar sea-ice diatom, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, to understand acclimation processes in both darkness and during the subsequent return to light. We measured parameters at specific time-points over 3 months of darkness, and then over 6 d after a return to light. Measured parameters included cell number and size, cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas, lipid and pigment contents, concentration of key proteins of the photosynthetic system, photosynthetic parameters based on both variable fluorescence and carbon assimilation, and the level of nonphotochemical quenching. A stable functional state was reached within a few days after the transition to dark and was then maintained throughout 3 months of darkness. The dark period resulted in a decrease of lipid droplet cell quota (-6\%), chlorophyll a cell quota (-41\%) and the maximum carbon fixation rate per cell (-98\%). Return to light after 1.5 months of darkness resulted in a strong induction of nonphotochemical quenching of excitation and a fast recovery of the maximum carbon fixation rate within 1 d, followed by a rapid increase in the cell number. Return to light after 3 months of darkness showed an increase of mortality or a profound downregulation induced over longer periods of darkness.},

Experiments were performed under manipulated pH levels (8.0, 7.7, 7.4, and 7.1) and different temperatures (1, 5, and 8 {\textdegree}C) to simulate changes from present to plausible future levels. Each of the 12 scenarios was run for 7 days, and a significant interaction between temperature and pH on growth was detected. By combining increased temperature and acidification, the two factors counterbalanced each other, and therefore no effect on the growth rates was found. However, the growth rates increased with elevated temperatures by {\textasciitilde} 20{\textendash}50 \% depending on the strain. In addition, a general negative effect of increasing acidification on growth was observed. At pH 7.7 and 7.4, the growth response varied considerably among strains. However, a more uniform response was detected at pH 7.1 with most of the strains exhibiting reduced growth rates by 20{\textendash}37 \% compared to pH 8.0. It should be emphasized that a significant interaction between temperature and pH was found, meaning that the combination of the two parameters affected growth differently than when considering one at a time. Based on these results, we anticipate that the polar diatom F. cylindrus will be unaffected by changes in temperature and pH within the range expected by the end of the century. In each simulated scenario, the variation in growth rates among the strains was larger than the variation observed due to the whole range of changes in either pH or temperature. Climate change may therefore not affect the species as such, but may lead to changes in the population structure of the species, with the strains exhibiting high phenotypic plasticity, in terms of temperature and pH tolerance towards future conditions, dominating the population.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of charge recombination of the S2QA- state in photosystem II was investigated by modifying the free energy gap between the quinone acceptor QA and the primary pheophytin acceptor Ph. This was done either by changing the midpoint potential of Ph (using mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis with a modified hydrogen bond to this cofactor), or that of QA (using different inhibitors of the QB pocket). The results show that the recombination rate is dependent on the free energy gap between Ph and QA, which confirms that the indirect recombination pathway involving formation of Ph- has a significant contribution. In the mutant with the largest free energy gap, direct electron transfer from QA- to P+ predominates. The temperature dependence of the recombination rate was investigated, showing a lower activation enthalpy in this mutant compared with the WT. The data allow the determination of the rate of the direct route and of its relative weight in the various strains. The set of currently accepted values for the midpoint potentials of the QA/QA-, Ph/Ph-, and P+/P* couples is not consistent with the relatively rapid rate of the indirect recombination pathway found here, nor with the 3\% yield of delayed fluorescence as previously estimated by de Grooth and van Gorkom (1981, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 635, 445-456). It is argued that a likely explanation is that the midpoint potentials of the two latter couples are more positive than believed due to electrostatic interactions. If such is the case, the estimation of the midpoint potential of the P+/P and S2/S1 couples must also be revised upward, with values of 1260 and 1020 mV, respectively.},

  abstract = {In the recombination process of Photosystem II (S2QA-{\textrightarrow}S1QA) the limiting step is the electron transfer from the reduced primary acceptor pheophytin Ph- to the oxidized primary donor P+ and the rate depends on the equilibrium constant between states S2PPhQA- and S1P+Ph-QA. Accordingly, mutations that affect the midpoint potential of Ph or of P result in a modified recombination rate. A strong correlation is observed between the effects on the recombination rate and on thermoluminescence (TL, the light emission from S2QA- during a warming ramp): a slower recombination corresponds to a large enhancement and higher temperature of the TL peak. The current theory of TL does not account for these effects, because it is based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step coincides with the radiative process. When implementing the known fact that the radiative pathway represents a minor leak, the modified TL theory readily accounts qualitatively for the observed behavior. However, the peak temperature is still lower than predicted from the temperature-dependence of recombination. We argue that this reflects the heterogeneity of the recombination process combined with the enhanced sensitivity of TL to slower components. The recombination kinetics are accurately fitted as a sum of two exponentials and we show that this is not due to a progressive stabilization of the charge-separated state, but to a pre-existing conformational heterogeneity.},

Constraints on the ability to grow at very low fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation fall into three categories. Category one includes essential processes whose efficiency is independent of the rate of energy input, but whose catalysts show phylogenetic variation leading to different energy costs for a given process in different taxa, e.g. light-harvesting complexes, RUBISCO and probably in the sensitivity of PsII to photodamage. The second category comprises essential processes whose efficiency decreases with decreasing energy input rate as a result of back-reactions independent of the energy input rate, e.g. charge recombination following charge separation by PsII and short-circuit H+ fluxes across the thylakoid membrane which decrease the fraction of pumped H+ which can be used in adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation. Category two also includes that component of protein turnover which cannot be related to replacement of polypeptides which were incorrectly assembled following uncorrected errors of transcription or translation, or which were damaged by processes whose rate increases with increasing energy input rate such as photodamage to PsII. The third category includes only O2-dependent damage to the D1 protein of PsII whose rate increases with a decreasing incident flux of photosynthetically active radiation. Processes in categories two and three are most likely to impose the lower limit on the photon flux density which can support photolithotrophic growth. The available literature, mainly on organisms which are not adapted to growth at very low photon flux densities, suggests that three major limitations (charge recombination in PsII, H+ leakage and slippage, and protein turnover) can individually impose lower limits in excess of 20\hspace{0.166em}nmol photon m-2\hspace{0.166em}s-1 on photolithotrophic growth. Furthermore, these three limitations are interactive, so that considering all three processes acting in series leads to an even higher predicted lower photon flux density limit for photolithotrophic growth.},

Measurements of spectral irradiance (E({$\lambda$})) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as samples for particulate absorption measurements were taken directly under the congelation ice, within the platelet layer, as profiles vertically through the water column, and at the benihic surface. Light attenuation by.sea ice, algal pigments, and particulates reduced PAR reaching the platelet ice layer to 3\%(9{\textendash}33 fimol photons m-2--s-1) of surface values and narrowed its spectral distribution to a band between 400 and 580 nm. Attenuation by the water column further reduced PAR reaching the sea floor (28{\textendash}m depth) to 0.05\% of surface levels ({$<$} 1 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1), with a spectral distribution dominated by 470{\textendash}580{\textendash}nm wavelengths. The photoadaptive index (I) for platelet ice algae (5.9{\textendash}12.6 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2.s-1) was similar to ambient PAR, indicating that algae had acclimated to their light environment (i.e. the algae were light-replete). Maximum Qa({$\lambda$}) at the blue absorption peak (440 nm) was 0.63, and enhanced absorption was observed from 460{\textendash}500 nm and was consistent with observed high cellular chlorophyll (chi) c:chl a and fucoxanthin: chl a molar ratios (0.4 and 1.2, respectively). Benthic algae were light-limited despite the maintenance of very low Ik values (4{\textendash}11 {$\mu$}mol photons.m-2.s-1). Extremely high fucoxanthin: chi a ratios (1.6) in benthic algae produced enhanced green light absorption, resulting in a high degree of complementation between algal absorption and ambient spectral irradiance. Qa({$\lambda$}) values for benthic algae were maximal (0.9) between 400 and 510 nm but remained {$>$}0.35 even at absorption minima. Strong spectral flattening, a characteristic of intense pigment packaging, was also apparent in the Qa({$\lambda$}) spectra for benthic algae. FE and Qa({$\lambda$}) spectra were similar in shape for platelet ice algae, indicating that the efficiency at which absorbed energy was transferred to photosystem II (PSII) was independent of wavelength. Fluorescence emission by benthic algae was greatest for the 500{\textendash}560{\textendash}nm excitation wavelengths, suggesting that most energy absorbed by accessory pigments was transferred to PSII. These results suggest that under ice algae employ complementary pigmentation and maximize absorption efficiency as adaptive strategies to low-light stress. Regulating the distribution of absorbed energy between PSI and PSII may be an adaptive response to the restricted spectral distribution of irradiance.},

  abstract = {Iron limitation is the major factor controlling phytoplankton growth in vast regions of the contemporary oceans. In this study, a combination of thermoluminescence (TL), chlorophyll fluorescence, and P700 absorbance measurements have been used to elucidate the effects of iron deficiency in the photosynthetic electron transport of the marine diatom P. tricornutum. TL was used to determine the effects of iron deficiency on photosystem II (PSII) activity. Excitation of iron-replete P. tricornutum cells with single turn-over flashes induced the appearance of TL glow curves with two components with different peaks of temperature and contributions to the total signal intensity: the B band (23{\textdegree}C, 63\%), and the AG band (40{\textdegree}C, 37\%). Iron limitation did not significantly alter these bands, but induced a decrease of the total TL signal. Far red excitation did not increase the amount of the AG band in iron-limited cells, as observed for iron-replete cells. The effect of iron deficiency on the photosystem I (PSI) activity was also examined by measuring the changes in P700 redox state during illumination. The electron donation to PSI was substantially reduced in iron-deficient cells. This could be related with the important decline on cytochrome c6 content observed in these cells. Iron deficiency also induced a marked increase in light sensitivity in P. tricornutum cells. A drastic increase in the level of peroxidation of chloroplast lipids was detected in iron-deficient cells even when grown under standard conditions at low light intensity. Illumination with a light intensity of 300 {$\mu$}E m-2 s-1 during different time periods caused a dramatic disappearance in TL signal in cells grown under low iron concentration, this treatment not affecting to the signal in iron-replete cells. The results of this work suggest that iron deficiency induces partial blocking of the electron transfer between PSII and PSI, due to a lower concentration of the electron donor cytochrome c6. This decreased electron transfer may induce the over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool and consequently the appearance of acceptor side photoinhibition in PSII even at low light intensities. The functionality of chlororespiratory electron transfer pathway under iron restricted conditions is also discussed.},

This is achieved by kinetic control: with forward reactions being faster than competing, energy-wasteful reactions. This requires appropriate cofactor spacing, driving forces and reorganizational energies. These features evolved in ancestral enzymes in a low O2 environment. When O2 appeared, energy-converting enzymes had to deal with its troublesome chemistry. Various protective mechanisms duly evolved that are not directly related to the enzymes' principal redox roles. These protective mechanisms involve fine-tuning of reduction potentials, switching of pathways and the use of short circuits, back-reactions and side-paths, all of which compromise efficiency. This energetic loss is worth it since it minimises damage from reactive derivatives of O2 and thus gives the organism a better chance of survival. We examine photosynthetic reaction centres, bc 1 and b 6 f complexes from this view point. In particular, the evolution of the heterodimeric PSI from its homodimeric ancestors is explained as providing a protective back-reaction pathway. This ``sacrifice-of-efficiency-for-protection'' concept should be generally applicable to bioenergetic enzymes in aerobic environments.},

Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in the development and application of ST-ChlF methods in aquatic ecosystems, and in the interpretation of the resulting observations. At the same time, however, an increasing number of sensor types, sampling protocols, and data processing algorithms have created confusion and uncertainty among potential users, with a growing divergence of practice among different research groups. In this review, we assist the existing and upcoming user community by providing an overview of current approaches and consensus recommendations for the use of ST-ChlF measurements to examine in-situ phytoplankton productivity and photo-physiology. We argue that a consistency of practice and adherence to basic operational and quality control standards is critical to ensuring data inter-comparability. Large datasets of inter-comparable and globally coherent ST-ChlF observations hold the potential to reveal large-scale patterns and trends in phytoplankton photo-physiology, photosynthetic rates and bottom-up controls on primary productivity. As such, they hold great potential to provide invaluable physiological observations on the scales relevant for the development and validation of ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms.},

  abstract = {Under environmental stress, plants and algae employ a variety of strategies to protect the photosynthetic apparatus and maintain photostasis. To date, most studies on stress acclimation have focused on model organisms which possess limited to no tolerance to stressful extremes. We studied the ability of the Antarctic alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO 241 (UWO 241) to acclimate to low temperature, high salinity or high light. UWO 241 maintained robust growth and photosynthetic activity at levels of temperature (2~{\textdegree}C) and salinity (700~mM NaCl) which were nonpermissive for a mesophilic sister species, Chlamydomonas raudensis SAG 49.72 (SAG 49.72). Acclimation in the mesophile involved classic mechanisms, including downregulation of light harvesting and shifts in excitation energy between photosystem I and II. In contrast, UWO 241 exhibited high rates of PSI-driven cyclic electron flow (CEF) and a larger capacity for nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Furthermore, UWO 241 exhibited constitutively high activity of two key ascorbate cycle enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase and maintained a large ascorbate pool. These results matched the ability of the psychrophile to maintain low ROS under short-term photoinhibition conditions. We conclude that tight control over photostasis and ROS levels are essential for photosynthetic life to flourish in a native habitat of permanent photooxidative stress.~We propose to rename this organism Chlamydomonas priscuii.},

  abstract = {Significance             Controls on phytoplankton productivity in the extreme environment of the Southern Ocean has received widespread attention. This polar region presents three challenges to primary producers: how to subsist under the joint constraints of low temperatures, low light, and growth-limiting concentrations of the essential trace element iron. The resident phytoplankton have overcome these extreme environmental conditions with a unique combination of physiological adaptations. They have modified parts of their photosynthetic machinery to harvest low levels of light without substantially increasing their iron requirements, and in a way that may exploit the low temperature in their environment. Together, these adaptations enable them to use iron and light more efficiently and grow faster than environmental conditions should otherwise permit.           ,                             Phytoplankton productivity in the polar Southern Ocean (SO) plays an important role in the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean's interior, a process called the biological carbon pump, which helps regulate global climate. SO productivity in turn is limited by low iron, light, and temperature, which restrict the efficiency of the carbon pump. Iron and light can colimit productivity due to the high iron content of the photosynthetic photosystems and the need for increased photosystems for low-light acclimation in many phytoplankton. Here we show that SO phytoplankton have evolved critical adaptations to enhance photosynthetic rates under the joint constraints of low iron, light, and temperature. Under growth-limiting iron and light levels, three SO species had up to sixfold higher photosynthetic rates per photosystem II and similar or higher rates per mol of photosynthetic iron than temperate species, despite their lower growth temperature (3 vs. 18 {\textdegree}C) and light intensity (30 vs. 40 {$\mu$}mol quanta{$\cdot$}m               2               {$\cdot$}s               -1               ), which should have decreased photosynthetic rates. These unexpectedly high rates in the SO species are partly explained by their unusually large photosynthetic antennae, which are among the largest ever recorded in marine phytoplankton. Large antennae are disadvantageous at low light intensities because they increase excitation energy loss as heat, but this loss may be mitigated by the low SO temperatures. Such adaptations point to higher SO production rates than environmental conditions should otherwise permit, with implications for regional ecology and biogeochemistry.},

  abstract = {Antarctic sea ice provides an ephemeral but important habitat for algal productivity and is characterised by extreme physicochemical variations. In this study, we assess the ability of a sea ice diatom (Fragilariopsis cylindrus) to cope with physicochemical changes through examination of physiological status and allocation of 14C-incorporated organic carbon into particulate and extracellular fractions, using closed-bottle incubations over 49d. Carbon allocation was found to vary with growth stage and shifts in the physicochemical environment, in particular the carbonate system. Total extracellular organic carbon was comprised of at least 85\% low molecular weight 14C-colloidal-organic carbon. The relative contribution of 14C-extracellular polymeric substances and 14C-total extracellular organic carbon to 14C-total primary production varied from lag to senescent growth phases, increasing from 0 to 5.7\% and 32.9\% to 69.5\%, respectively. Carbon allocation into 14C-extracellular polymeric substances was correlated with a decline in CO2 availability and increased pH. Overall, the results demonstrate that carbon exudation may play an important role in adaptive algal physiology by buffering cells against biogeochemical shifts within brine channels, induced through photosynthetic activity.},

Here, we propose a new model of photoinhibition in which charge recombination processes have a double-faced role: first, photodamage is induced by singlet oxygen, which is produced via interaction with the triplet reaction center chlorophyll (3P680) arising from the recombination of the charge-separated state between P680 and the pheophytin electron acceptor (3[P680+Phe-]). Second, photoprotection is provided by competition between 3[P680+Phe-] formation and direct recombination of the 1[P680+Phe-] and P680+QA- states. The efficiency of these two pathways is under control of the redox potential of the Phe and QA electron acceptors, which is utilized during adaptation to high light conditions.},
