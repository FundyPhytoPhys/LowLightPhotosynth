This Review addresses four major complementary questions of ongoing Arctic Ocean changes and associated impacts on phytoplankton productivity, phenology and assemblage composition. We highlight trends in primary production over the last two decades while considering how multiple environmental drivers shape Arctic biogeography. Further, we consider changes to Arctic phenology by borealization and hidden under-ice blooms, and how the diversity of phytoplankton assemblages might evolve in a novel Arctic `biogeochemical landscape'. It is critical to understand these aspects of changing Arctic phytoplankton dynamics as they exert pressure on marine Arctic ecosystems in addition to direct effects from rapid environmental changes.},

How Arctic diatom photoadaptation strategies differ across their heterogeneous light niches remains a poorly documented but crucial missing link to anticipate Arctic Ocean responses to shrinking sea-ice and increasing light. To address this question, we selected five Arctic diatom species with diverse life traits, representative of distinct light niches across the seasonal light environment continuum: from snow-covered dimly lit bottom ice to summer stratified waters. We studied their photoacclimation plasticity to two growth light levels and the subsequent responses of their nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and xanthophyll cycle to both dark incubations and light shifts. We deciphered NPQ and xanthophyll cycle tuning in darkness and their light-dependent induction kinetics, which aligned with species' light niche occupancy. In ice-related species, NPQ was sustained in darkness and its induction was more reactive to moderate light shifts. Open-water species triggered strong NPQ induction in darkness and reached higher maximal NPQ under high light. Marginal ice zone species showed strong adaptation to light fluctuations with a dark response fine-tuned depending upon light history. We argue these traits are anchored in diverging photoadaption strategies fostering Arctic diatom success in their respective light niches.},

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis, a complete water oxidation cycle requires absorption of four photons by the chlorophylls of photosystem II (PSII). The photons can be provided successively by applying short flashes of light. Already in 1970, Kok and coworkers [Photochem Photobiol 11:457\textendash 475, 1970] developed a basic model to explain the flash-number dependence of O2 formation. The third flash applied to dark-adapted PSII induces the S3\textrightarrow S4{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition, which is coupled to dioxygen formation at a protein-bound Mn4Ca complex. The sequence of events leading to dioxygen formation and the role of Kok's enigmatic S4-state are only incompletely understood. Recently we have shown by time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy that in the S3{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition an interesting intermediate is formed, prior to the onset of O\textendash O bond formation [Haumann et~al. Science 310:1019\textendash 1021, 2005]. The experimental results of the time-resolved X-ray experiments are discussed. The identity of the reaction intermediate is considered and the question is addressed how the novel intermediate is related to the S4-state proposed in 1970 by Bessel Kok. This leads us to an extension of the classical S-state cycle towards a basic model which describes sequence and interplay of electron and proton abstraction events at the donor side of PSII [Dau and Haumann, Science 312:1471\textendash 1472, 2006].},

  abstract = {The oxygen production of dark-adapted Photosystem II upon illumination by a series of single-turnover flashes shows a damped period four oscillation with flash number. The damping is attributed to `misses' resulting from a statistical probability that a reaction center fails to produce a stable charge separation after a saturating flash. The origin of misses is of interest because its probable dependence on flash number, in principle, affects the quantitative interpretation of all measurements on phenomena associated with the period four oscillation. We show that the kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence yield transients induced by a flash series can be used to estimate the relative amplitudes of the miss probability on each flash. It is concluded that a major part of the misses must be caused by failure of the reduction of the oxidized primary electron donor chlorophyll P680+ by the secondary donor tyrosine YZ before the charge separation is lost by recombination. The probability of this failure is found to increase with the oxidation state of the oxygen-evolving complex: more than half of it occurs upon charge separation in the S3 state, which is attributed to the presence of YZox S2 in Boltzmann equilibrium with YZS3.},

This method determines the transit times of electrons that pass through PSII during the successive steps in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation/O2 formation (S states) and plastoquinone reduction in any oxygenic phototroph (in vivo or in vitro). We report the first measurements from intact living cells, illustrated by a eukaryotic alga (Nannochloropsis oceanica). We demonstrate that S state transition times depend strongly on the redox state of the PSII acceptor side, at both QB and the plastoquinone pool which serve as the major locus of regulation of PSII electron flux. We provide evidence for a kinetic intermediate S3{${'}$} state (lifetime 220 {$\mu$}s) following formation of S3 and prior to the release of O2.

Onset of the spring bloom of ice algae is typically limited by the availability of light, and the current consensus is that a few tens-of-centimeters of snow is enough to prevent sufficient solar radiation to reach underneath the sea ice. We challenge this consensus, and investigated the onset and the light requirement of an ice algae spring bloom, and the importance of snow optical properties for light penetration. Colonization by ice algae began in May under {$>$}1 m of first-year sea ice with {$\sim$}1 m thick snow cover on top, in NE Greenland. The initial growth of ice algae began at extremely low irradiance ({$<$}0.17 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1) and was documented as an increase in Chlorophyll a concentration, an increase in algal cell number, and a viable photosynthetic activity. Snow thickness changed little during May (from 110 to 91 cm), however the snow temperature increased steadily, as observed from automated high-frequency temperature profiles. We propose that changes in snow optical properties, caused by temperature-driven snow metamorphosis, was the primary driver for allowing sufficient light to penetrate through the thick snow and initiate algae growth below the sea ice. This was supported by radiative-transfer modeling of light attenuation. Implications are an earlier productivity by ice algae in Arctic sea ice than recognized previously.},

Despite numerous studies on overwintering strategies, such as utilization of stored energy products, formation of resting stages, reduction of metabolic rates and heterotrophic lifestyles, there have been few attempts to assess the in situ physiological state and restoration of the photosynthetic apparatus upon re-illumination. In this study, we found diverse and active marine phytoplankton communities during the polar night at 78\textdegree N. Furthermore, we observed rapid changes ({$\leq$}20 min) in the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport upon re-illumination. High photosynthetic capacity and net primary production were established after 24 h of re-illumination. Our results suggest that some Arctic autotrophs maintain fully functional photosystem II and downstream electron acceptors during the polar night even though the low in situ net primary production levels measured in January prove that light was not sufficient to support any measurable primary production. Due to low temperatures resulting in low respiratory rates as well as the absence of photodamage during the polar night, maintenance of basic photosynthetic machinery may actually pose relatively low metabolic costs for algal cells. This could allow Arctic microalgae to endure the polar night without the formation of dormant stages, enabling them to recover and take advantage of light immediately upon the suns return during the winter\textendash spring transition.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems at high latitudes are characterized by extreme seasonal changes in light conditions, as well as a limited period of high primary production during spring and early summer. As light returns at the end of winter to Arctic ice-covered seas, a first algal bloom takes place in the bottom layer of the sea ice. This bottom ice algae community develops through three distinct phases in the transition from winter to spring, starting with phase I, a predominantly net heterotroph community that has limited interaction with the pelagic or benthic realms. Phase II begins in the spring once light for photosynthesis becomes available at the ice bottom, although interaction with the water column and benthos remains limited. The transition to the final phase III is then mainly driven by a balance of atmospheric and oceanographic forcing that induce structural changes in the sea ice and ultimately the removal of algal biomass from the ice. Due to limited data availability an incomplete understanding exists of all the processes determining ice algal bloom phenology and the considerable geographic differences in sympagic algal standing stocks and primary production. We present here the first pan-Arctic compilation of available time-series data on vernal sea ice algal bloom development and identify the most important factors controlling its development and termination. Using data from the area surrounding Resolute Bay (Nunavut, Canada) as an example, we support previous investigations that snow cover on top of the ice influences sea ice algal phenology, with highest biomass development, but also earliest termination of blooms, under low snow cover. We also provide a pan-Arctic overview of sea ice algae standing stocks and primary production, and discuss the pertinent processes behind the geographic differences we observed. Finally, we assess potential future changes in vernal algal bloom phenology as a consequence of climate change, including their importance to different groups of grazers.},

The Green Edge initiative was developed to investigate the processes controlling the primary productivity and the fate of organic matter produced during the Arctic phytoplankton spring bloom (PSB) and to determine its role in the ecosystem. Two field campaigns were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at an ice camp located on landfast sea ice southeast of Qikiqtarjuaq Island in Baffin Bay (67.4797N, 63.7895W). During both expeditions, a large suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured beneath a consolidated sea ice cover from the surface to the bottom at 360\,m depth to better understand the factors driving the PSB. Key variables such as temperature, salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured at the ice camp. Here, we present the results of a joint effort to tidy and standardize the collected data sets that will facilitate their reuse in other Arctic studies.

  abstract = {Arctic photoautotrophic communities must survive through polar night darkness until light returns in spring. We tracked changes in the cellular resource allocations and functional capacities of a polar sea-ice diatom, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, to understand acclimation processes in both darkness and during the subsequent return to light. We measured parameters at specific time-points over 3 months of darkness, and then over 6 d after a return to light. Measured parameters included cell number and size, cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas, lipid and pigment contents, concentration of key proteins of the photosynthetic system, photosynthetic parameters based on both variable fluorescence and carbon assimilation, and the level of nonphotochemical quenching. A stable functional state was reached within a few days after the transition to dark and was then maintained throughout 3 months of darkness. The dark period resulted in a decrease of lipid droplet cell quota (-6\%), chlorophyll a cell quota (-41\%) and the maximum carbon fixation rate per cell (-98\%). Return to light after 1.5 months of darkness resulted in a strong induction of nonphotochemical quenching of excitation and a fast recovery of the maximum carbon fixation rate within 1 d, followed by a rapid increase in the cell number. Return to light after 3 months of darkness showed an increase of mortality or a profound downregulation induced over longer periods of darkness.},

To explore the life of phytoplankton during and after the polar night, we used robotic ice-avoiding profiling floats to measure ocean optics and phytoplankton characteristics continuously through two annual cycles in Baffin Bay, an Arctic sea that is covered by ice for 7 months a year. We demonstrate that net phytoplankton growth occurred even under 100\% ice cover as early as February and that it resulted at least partly from photosynthesis. This highlights the adaptation of Arctic phytoplankton to extreme low-light conditions, which may be key to their survival before seeding the spring bloom.},

Accordingly, mutations that affect the midpoint potential of Ph or of P result in a modified recombination rate. A strong correlation is observed between the effects on the recombination rate and on thermoluminescence (TL, the light emission from S2QA- during a warming ramp): a slower recombination corresponds to a large enhancement and higher temperature of the TL peak. The current theory of TL does not account for these effects, because it is based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step coincides with the radiative process. When implementing the known fact that the radiative pathway represents a minor leak, the modified TL theory readily accounts qualitatively for the observed behavior. However, the peak temperature is still lower than predicted from the temperature-dependence of recombination. We argue that this reflects the heterogeneity of the recombination process combined with the enhanced sensitivity of TL to slower components. The recombination kinetics are accurately fitted as a sum of two exponentials and we show that this is not due to a progressive stabilization of the charge-separated state, but to a pre-existing conformational heterogeneity.},

Constraints on the ability to grow at very low fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation fall into three categories. Category one includes essential processes whose efficiency is independent of the rate of energy input, but whose catalysts show phylogenetic variation leading to different energy costs for a given process in different taxa, e.g. light-harvesting complexes, RUBISCO and probably in the sensitivity of PsII to photodamage. The second category comprises essential processes whose efficiency decreases with decreasing energy input rate as a result of back-reactions independent of the energy input rate, e.g. charge recombination following charge separation by PsII and short-circuit H+ fluxes across the thylakoid membrane which decrease the fraction of pumped H+ which can be used in adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation. Category two also includes that component of protein turnover which cannot be related to replacement of polypeptides which were incorrectly assembled following uncorrected errors of transcription or translation, or which were damaged by processes whose rate increases with increasing energy input rate such as photodamage to PsII. The third category includes only O2-dependent damage to the D1 protein of PsII whose rate increases with a decreasing incident flux of photosynthetically active radiation. Processes in categories two and three are most likely to impose the lower limit on the photon flux density which can support photolithotrophic growth. The available literature, mainly on organisms which are not adapted to growth at very low photon flux densities, suggests that three major limitations (charge recombination in PsII, H+ leakage and slippage, and protein turnover) can individually impose lower limits in excess of 20\hspace{0.166em}nmol photon m-2\hspace{0.166em}s-1 on photolithotrophic growth. Furthermore, these three limitations are interactive, so that considering all three processes acting in series leads to an even higher predicted lower photon flux density limit for photolithotrophic growth.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton photosynthetic physiology can be investigated through single-turnover variable chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) approaches, which carry unique potential to autonomously collect data at high spatial and temporal resolution. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in the development and application of ST-ChlF methods in aquatic ecosystems, and in the interpretation of the resulting observations. At the same time, however, an increasing number of sensor types, sampling protocols, and data processing algorithms have created confusion and uncertainty among potential users, with a growing divergence of practice among different research groups. In this review, we assist the existing and upcoming user community by providing an overview of current approaches and consensus recommendations for the use of ST-ChlF measurements to examine in-situ phytoplankton productivity and photo-physiology. We argue that a consistency of practice and adherence to basic operational and quality control standards is critical to ensuring data inter-comparability. Large datasets of inter-comparable and globally coherent ST-ChlF observations hold the potential to reveal large-scale patterns and trends in phytoplankton photo-physiology, photosynthetic rates and bottom-up controls on primary productivity. As such, they hold great potential to provide invaluable physiological observations on the scales relevant for the development and validation of ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms.},

  abstract = {Significance             Controls on phytoplankton productivity in the extreme environment of the Southern Ocean has received widespread attention. This polar region presents three challenges to primary producers: how to subsist under the joint constraints of low temperatures, low light, and growth-limiting concentrations of the essential trace element iron. The resident phytoplankton have overcome these extreme environmental conditions with a unique combination of physiological adaptations. They have modified parts of their photosynthetic machinery to harvest low levels of light without substantially increasing their iron requirements, and in a way that may exploit the low temperature in their environment. Together, these adaptations enable them to use iron and light more efficiently and grow faster than environmental conditions should otherwise permit.           ,                             Phytoplankton productivity in the polar Southern Ocean (SO) plays an important role in the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean's interior, a process called the biological carbon pump, which helps regulate global climate. SO productivity in turn is limited by low iron, light, and temperature, which restrict the efficiency of the carbon pump. Iron and light can colimit productivity due to the high iron content of the photosynthetic photosystems and the need for increased photosystems for low-light acclimation in many phytoplankton. Here we show that SO phytoplankton have evolved critical adaptations to enhance photosynthetic rates under the joint constraints of low iron, light, and temperature. Under growth-limiting iron and light levels, three SO species had up to sixfold higher photosynthetic rates per photosystem II and similar or higher rates per mol of photosynthetic iron than temperate species, despite their lower growth temperature (3 vs. 18 \textdegree C) and light intensity (30 vs. 40 {$\mu$}mol quanta{$\cdot$}m               2               {$\cdot$}s               -1               ), which should have decreased photosynthetic rates. These unexpectedly high rates in the SO species are partly explained by their unusually large photosynthetic antennae, which are among the largest ever recorded in marine phytoplankton. Large antennae are disadvantageous at low light intensities because they increase excitation energy loss as heat, but this loss may be mitigated by the low SO temperatures. Such adaptations point to higher SO production rates than environmental conditions should otherwise permit, with implications for regional ecology and biogeochemistry.},

Chlorophyll a fluorescence and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII decreased during long darkness in a species-specific manner, whereas chlorophyll a concentration remained mostly unchanged. Phaeocystis antarctica showed the strongest decline in photosynthetic fitness during darkness, which coincided with a reduced capacity to recover after darkness, suggesting a loss of functional photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers. The diatom C. simplex at 4\textdegree C showed the strongest capacity to resume photosynthesis and active growth during 7 weeks of darkness. In all species, the maintenance of photosynthetic fitness during darkness was clearly temperature dependent as shown by the stronger decline of photosynthetic fitness at 7\textdegree C compared to 4\textdegree C. Although we lack direct evidence for this, we suggest that temperature-enhanced respiration rates cause stronger depletion of energy reserves that subsequently interferes with the maintenance of photosynthetic fitness during long darkness. Therefore, the current low temperatures in the coastal Southern Ocean may aid the maintenance of photosynthetic fitness during the austral winter. Further experiments should examine to what extent the species-specific differences in dark survival are relevant for future temperature scenarios for the coastal Southern Ocean.},
