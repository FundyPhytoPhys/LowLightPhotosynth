# Background
Light energy absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments of PSII (primarily chlorophyll-a) is distributed variably among three pathways @schubackSingleTurnoverVariableChlorophyll2021:    
I.	Photochemistry (photochemical quenching of ChlF)    
II.	Dissipation as heat (non-photochemical quenching of ChlF)   
III.	Re-emission at longer wavelengths as fluorescence (ChlF)    

A complete water oxidation cycle during oxygenic photosynthesis requires the absorption of four photons and the successive accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents @zaharievaEnergeticsKineticsSState2019 @dauTimeresolvedXraySpectroscopy2007 @gatesRealtimeKineticsLight2020: 

![Figure 1: Pathway of s-state cycling and the electron transfer chain in PSII. Successive PSII charge separations extract electrons from the Mn cluster of the water-oxidizing/oxygen-evolving complex, inducing four increasingly oxidized states (S0 â†’ S4). Following the accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents, 2 H2O are oxidized to 1 O2. Figure inspired by Gates et al., 2020 and Dau & Haumann, 2007.](Figure_1.png)   

Occasionally, recombination may result in the loss of charge separation, desynchronizing the s-state cycle and dampening the periodicity. 


## Objective    
Use a single-turnover variable chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) approach to evaluate the loss of synchronization of the s-state cycle at different frequencies of photon delivery and temperatures.     

# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the R Markdown you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > HTML/CSS > PDF. You can even use the bibliography the same way [@R-posterdown].

# Results


Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam placerat augue at velit tincidunt semper. Donec elementum porta posuere. Nullam interdum, odio at tincidunt feugiat, turpis nisi blandit eros, eu posuere risus felis non quam. Nam eget lorem odio. Duis et aliquet orci. Phasellus nec viverra est.

```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html")
```

Or with figures: Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), or Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs).

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=5}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```

```{r morefigs, out.width='80%', echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=5}
data <- iris

plot(x = data$Sepal.Length, 
     y = data$Sepal.Width, 
     col = data$Species,
     pch = 19, 
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)")

```

Curabitur sagittis vitae arcu eget faucibus. In non elementum felis. Duis et aliquam nunc. Nunc pulvinar sapien nunc, vel pretium nisi efficitur in. Fusce fringilla maximus leo et maximus.

# Future Directions 
The accepted lower limit of the photic zone is 1% of surface irradiance, equivalent to 1 photon reaching a PSII every ~0.03 seconds @ravenPutOutLight2000. However, some arctic diatoms may achieve net C uptake when 1 photon only reaches a PSII every 0.6-60 seconds. 
Comparing the duration of s-state synchronicity of temperate and arctic diatoms may help explain how arctic diatoms exploit extremely low light.
