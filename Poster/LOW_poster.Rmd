# Background
Light energy absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments of PSII (primarily chlorophyll-a) is distributed variably among three pathways @schubackSingleTurnoverVariableChlorophyll2021:    
I.	Photochemistry (photochemical quenching of ChlF)    
II.	Dissipation as heat (non-photochemical quenching of ChlF)   
III.	Re-emission at longer wavelengths as fluorescence (ChlF)    

A complete water oxidation cycle during oxygenic photosynthesis requires the absorption of four photons and the successive accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents @zaharievaEnergeticsKineticsSState2019 @dauTimeresolvedXraySpectroscopy2007 @gatesRealtimeKineticsLight2020: 

![Figure 1: Pathway of s-state cycling and the electron transfer chain in PSII. Successive PSII charge separations extract electrons from the Mn cluster of the water-oxidizing/oxygen-evolving complex, inducing four increasingly oxidized states (S0 → S4). Following the accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents, 2 H2O are oxidized to 1 O2. Figure inspired by Gates et al., 2020 and Dau & Haumann, 2007.](Figure_1.png)   

ChlF differs between s-states since the free energy of the water-oxidizing complex depends on the number of electrons/protons removed @dewijnSstateDependenceMiss2002. Occasionally, recombination may result in the loss of charge separation, desynchronizing the s-state cycle and dampening the ChlF periodicity. 


# Objective    
Use a single-turnover variable chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) approach to evaluate the loss of synchronization of the s-state cycle at different frequencies of photon delivery and temperatures.     

# Methods



# Results and Discussion

![Figure 3: Maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of PSII in temperate diatoms exposed to single-turnover flashes spaced at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 seconds at 10 and 18 degrees Celsius.](FvFm_vs_Flashnumber_scaled.png)

As flash spacing increases, we observe fewer synchronous s-state cycles before the periodicity is dampened. This indicates that longer periods of time between flashes increase the incidence of recombination. 

Recombination processes are temperature sensitive. As a result, competition from recombination should decrease with temperature. Therefore, the diatoms at 10°C should maintain a synchronous s-state cycle for longer. However, a more sophisticated time series analysis is required to derive the relationship between temperature and photochemistry for this dataset. 

# Future Directions 
The accepted lower limit of the photic zone is 1% of surface irradiance, equivalent to 1 photon reaching a PSII every ~0.03 seconds @ravenPutOutLight2000. However, some arctic diatoms may achieve net C uptake when 1 photon only reaches a PSII every 0.6-60 seconds. 

Comparing the duration of s-state synchronicity of temperate and arctic diatoms may help explain how arctic diatoms exploit extremely low light.
