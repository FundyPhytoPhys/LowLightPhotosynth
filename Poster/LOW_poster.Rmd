# Background
Accepted lower limit of the photic zone: 1% of surface irradiance, equivalent to 1 photon reaching a PSII every ~0.03 seconds @ravenPutOutLight2000. Some arctic diatoms achieve net C uptake with 1 photon only reaching a PSII every 0.6-60 seconds @randelhoff2020.           

  Comparing the persistence of s-state synchronicity in temperate and arctic diatoms may help explain how arctic diatoms exploit extremely low light.        

**Energy Distribution**  
Light energy absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments of PSII (primarily chl-a) is distributed variably among three pathways @schubackSingleTurnoverVariableChlorophyll2021:  

  * Photochemistry (photochemical quenching of ChlF)    
  * Dissipation as heat (non-photochemical quenching of ChlF)   
  * Re-emission at longer wavelengths as fluorescence (ChlF)    

**S-State Cycle**   
A complete water oxidation cycle during oxygenic photosynthesis requires the absorption of four photons and the successive accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents  @gatesRealtimeKineticsLight2020@zaharievaEnergeticsKineticsSState2019@dauTimeresolvedXraySpectroscopy2007:  

![Figure 1: Pathway of s-state cycling and the electron transfer chain in PSII. Successive PSII charge separations extract electrons from the Mn cluster of the water-oxidizing/oxygen-evolving complex, inducing four increasingly oxidized states (S~0~ → S~4~). Following the accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents, 2 H~2~O are oxidized to 1 O~2~.](figure_sstate.png)

ChlF differs between s-states since the free energy of the water-oxidizing complex depends on the number of electrons/protons removed @dewijnSstateDependenceMiss2002. A loss of charge separation through recombination desynchronizes the s-state cycle, dampening the periodic changes in ChlF. 



# Objective    
Use a single-turnover variable chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) approach to evaluate the loss of synchronization of the s-state cycle at different frequencies of photon delivery and temperatures.     

# Methods

Use Solisense apparatus and Lift software to deliver short, highly intense pulses of light to diatoms (*Thalassiosira pseudonana*) in a temperature-controlled cuvette @schubackSingleTurnoverVariableChlorophyll2021.

Derive the maximum quantum yield of PSII (F~v~/F~m~)   

  *  Indicates the maximum efficiency of photochemistry under different conditions 


# Results and Discussion

![Figure 3: Maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of PSII in temperate diatoms exposed to single-turnover flashes spaced at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 seconds at 10 and 18 degrees Celsius.](FvFm_vs_Flashnumber_scaled.png)

As flash spacing increases, we observe fewer synchronous s-state cycles before the periodicity is dampened. This indicates that longer periods of time between flashes increase the incidence of recombination. 

We hypothesized that recombination would decrease with temperature since recombination processes are temperature sensitive. As a result, we expected the diatoms at 10°C to maintain a synchronous s-state cycle for longer. However, a more sophisticated time series analysis is required to derive the relationship between temperature and photochemistry for this data set.
