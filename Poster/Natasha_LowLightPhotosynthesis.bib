  abstract = {Over the seasons, Arctic diatom species occupy shifting habitats defined by contrasting light climates, constrained by snow and ice cover dynamics interacting with extreme photoperiod and solar angle variations. How Arctic diatom photoadaptation strategies differ across their heterogeneous light niches remains a poorly documented but crucial missing link to anticipate Arctic Ocean responses to shrinking sea-ice and increasing light. To address this question, we selected five Arctic diatom species with diverse life traits, representative of distinct light niches across the seasonal light environment continuum: from snow-covered dimly lit bottom ice to summer stratified waters. We studied their photoacclimation plasticity to two growth light levels and the subsequent responses of their nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and xanthophyll cycle to both dark incubations and light shifts. We deciphered NPQ and xanthophyll cycle tuning in darkness and their light-dependent induction kinetics, which aligned with species' light niche occupancy. In ice-related species, NPQ was sustained in darkness and its induction was more reactive to moderate light shifts. Open-water species triggered strong NPQ induction in darkness and reached higher maximal NPQ under high light. Marginal ice zone species showed strong adaptation to light fluctuations with a dark response fine-tuned depending upon light history. We argue these traits are anchored in diverging photoadaption strategies fostering Arctic diatom success in their respective light niches.},

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis, a complete water oxidation cycle requires absorption of four photons by the chlorophylls of photosystem II (PSII). The photons can be provided successively by applying short flashes of light. Already in 1970, Kok and coworkers [Photochem Photobiol 11:457\textendash 475, 1970] developed a basic model to explain the flash-number dependence of O2 formation. The third flash applied to dark-adapted PSII induces the S3\textrightarrow S4{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition, which is coupled to dioxygen formation at a protein-bound Mn4Ca complex. The sequence of events leading to dioxygen formation and the role of Kok's enigmatic S4-state are only incompletely understood. Recently we have shown by time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy that in the S3{$\Rightarrow$}S0 transition an interesting intermediate is formed, prior to the onset of O\textendash O bond formation [Haumann et~al. Science 310:1019\textendash 1021, 2005]. The experimental results of the time-resolved X-ray experiments are discussed. The identity of the reaction intermediate is considered and the question is addressed how the novel intermediate is related to the S4-state proposed in 1970 by Bessel Kok. This leads us to an extension of the classical S-state cycle towards a basic model which describes sequence and interplay of electron and proton abstraction events at the donor side of PSII [Dau and Haumann, Science 312:1471\textendash 1472, 2006].},

  abstract = {There is considerable interest in improving plant productivity by altering the dynamic responses of photosynthesis in tune with natural conditions. This is exemplified by the `energy-dependent' form of non-photochemical quenching (qE), the formation and decay of which can be considerably slower than natural light fluctuations, limiting photochemical yield. In addition, we recently reported that rapidly fluctuating light can produce field recombination-induced photodamage (FRIP), where large spikes in electric field across the thylakoid membrane ({$\Delta\psi$}) induce photosystem II recombination reactions that produce damaging singlet oxygen (1O2). Both qE and FRIP are directly linked to the thylakoid proton motive force (pmf), and in particular, the slow kinetics of partitioning pmf into its {$\Delta$}pH and {$\Delta\psi$} components. Using a series of computational simulations, we explored the possibility of `hacking' pmf partitioning as a target for improving photosynthesis. Under a range of illumination conditions, increasing the rate of counter-ion fluxes across the thylakoid membrane should lead to more rapid dissipation of {$\Delta\psi$} and formation of {$\Delta$}pH. This would result in increased rates for the formation and decay of qE while resulting in a more rapid decline in the amplitudes of {$\Delta\psi$}-spikes and decreasing 1O2 production. These results suggest that ion fluxes may be a viable target for plant breeding or engineering. However, these changes also induce transient, but substantial mismatches in the ATP : NADPH output ratio as well as in the osmotic balance between the lumen and stroma, either of which may explain why evolution has not already accelerated thylakoid ion fluxes. Overall, though the model is simplified, it recapitulates many of the responses seen in vivo, while spotlighting critical aspects of the complex interactions between pmf components and photosynthetic processes. By making the programme available, we hope to enable the community of photosynthesis researchers to further explore and test specific hypotheses. This article is part of the themed issue `Enhancing photosynthesis in crop plants: targets for improvement'.},

  abstract = {The oxygen production of dark-adapted Photosystem II upon illumination by a series of single-turnover flashes shows a damped period four oscillation with flash number. The damping is attributed to `misses' resulting from a statistical probability that a reaction center fails to produce a stable charge separation after a saturating flash. The origin of misses is of interest because its probable dependence on flash number, in principle, affects the quantitative interpretation of all measurements on phenomena associated with the period four oscillation. We show that the kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence yield transients induced by a flash series can be used to estimate the relative amplitudes of the miss probability on each flash. It is concluded that a major part of the misses must be caused by failure of the reduction of the oxidized primary electron donor chlorophyll P680+ by the secondary donor tyrosine YZ before the charge separation is lost by recombination. The probability of this failure is found to increase with the oxidation state of the oxygen-evolving complex: more than half of it occurs upon charge separation in the S3 state, which is attributed to the presence of YZox S2 in Boltzmann equilibrium with YZS3.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are an important group of primary producers in the aquatic environment. They are able to acclimate to fast changes in the light intensity by various mechanisms including a rise in non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ). The latter has been attributed to the xanthophyll cycle (XC) following activation of diadinoxanthin de-epoxidase by the acidification of the thylakoid lumen. To examine whether fluorescence quenching in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum depends on the {$\Delta$}pH generated by the photosynthetic electron transport, we arrested the latter by 3-(3{${'}$},4{${'}$}-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). This treatment hardly affected the NPQ or XC, even when methylviologen was present. Dissipation of the {$\Delta$}pH by 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited the XC but did not alter NPQ. Similar results, i.e. inhibition of the XC but normal fluorescence quenching, were observed when the experiments were performed at 3\textdegree C. Measurements of thermoluminescence showed that excess light treatment caused a marked decline in the signals obtained as a result of recombination of QB- with the S3 state of the Mn cluster; this was also observed in cells treated with DCMU (recombination of QA- with S2). Light treatment also diminished the QA- re-oxidation signals. The data suggest that changes in PSII core centre itself due to exposure to excess light conditions play an important part in the acclimation of P. tricornutum to the changing light conditions.},

This method determines the transit times of electrons that pass through PSII during the successive steps in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation/O2 formation (S states) and plastoquinone reduction in any oxygenic phototroph (in vivo or in vitro). We report the first measurements from intact living cells, illustrated by a eukaryotic alga (Nannochloropsis oceanica). We demonstrate that S state transition times depend strongly on the redox state of the PSII acceptor side, at both QB and the plastoquinone pool which serve as the major locus of regulation of PSII electron flux. We provide evidence for a kinetic intermediate S3{${'}$} state (lifetime 220 {$\mu$}s) following formation of S3 and prior to the release of O2.

Fluctuating light influences photosynthesis, respiration, biosynthesis, and growth at different timescales, but the interplay of these processes is not well-understood. Subsamples of a phytoplankton community from the turbid, well-mixed lake TaiHu (China) were either vertically moved through different mixing depths or incubated at fixed depths of matching daily light supply. Growth, photosynthetic electron transport rates, net oxygen production, and night respiration were measured for 9 days. Production was investigated during cyclic mixing, throughout the day, and among days of different integral light intensities. Electron transport rates were higher during vertical mixing and increased with mixing depth, therefore mixing phytoplankton better exploited short periods of surface illumination. On the other hand, light-stimulation of oxygen consumption and photoperiod shortening increased the compensation light intensities for daily production and growth. The communities kept at the surface and sub-surface were photoinhibited; their net oxygen production declined and compensation light intensity increased in the afternoon. There was no sign of afternoon depression of net oxygen production in mixing phytoplankton which metabolized photosynthetic products in periodic phases of low light in deeper layers. Mixing phytoplankton produced more oxygen during increasing light intensities and respired more at decreasing light intensities, decreasing net oxygen production during the day. This cyclic post-illumination enhancement of respiration seemed to be hardwired to fluctuating light, regardless of mixing depth and uncoupled from night respiration rates. Photosynthesis and respiration seemed more tightly connected under fluctuating than constant light.},

Lowering the number of turnovers of proton-producing redox components by decreasing the flash intensity increased the number of flashes required for the onset of ATP formation. Thus, regardless of the intensity, the accumulation of the same number of hydrogen ions was needed for phosphorylation to begin. Since the size of the threshold input was constant over a very wide range of proton accumulation rates, it follows that there were no significant proton leakages during the filling of the pool to its threshold level. However, non-productive leaks were initiated once phosphorylation began since progressively lower phosphorylation efficiencies were observed at lower and lower flash intensities. It is difficult to explain this observation except in terms of competing, non-phosphorylating hydrogen ion fluxes only when the threshold accumulation had been reached. We observed an increase in the permeability of thylakoid membrane to hydrogen ions that correlated with indications of coupling factor activity: the onset of ATP synthesis, the release of tightly bound ADP and, in dithiothreitol treated membranes, the initiation of ATPase activity. Our data support the notion that the dependence of coupling factor activation and deactivation on the {$\Delta$}pH accounts for the substantial changes in the ion conductivity that occur in thylakoid membranes.},

The model was used to estimate daily and annual production and, using measured carbon content, the potential vertical accumulation of the mats over a year. An annual pattern of photosynthesis was predicted for both lakes, with net production from October to February and net respiration at other times. Predicted rates and patterns of net photosynthesis were remarkably similar in the two lakes, despite differences in light climate: the ice of Lake Hoare transmits 1\textendash 4\% incident radiation, whereas that of Lake Vanda transmits up to 20\%.

The following observations and conclusions are reported: 1. Light flashes always produce the same number of oxidizing equivalents either as precursor or as O2. 2. The number of unstable precursor equivalents present during steady state photosynthesis is {$\sim$} 1.2 per photochemical trapping center. 3. The cooperation of the four photochemically formed oxidizing equivalents occurs essentially in the individual reaction centers and the final O2 evolution step is a one quantum process. 4. The data are compatible with a linear four step mechanism in which a trapping center, or an associated catalyst, (S) successively accumulates four + charges. The S4+ state produces O2 and returns to the ground state S0. 5. Besides S0 also the first oxidized state S+ is stable in the dark, the two higher states, S2+ and S3+ are not. 6. The relaxation times of some of the photooxidation steps were estimated. The fastest reaction, presumably S*1{$\leftarrow$}S2, has a (first) half time {$\leq$} 200 {$\mu$}sec. The S*2 state and probably also the S*0 state are processed somewhat more slowly (\texttildelow{} 300\textendash 400 {$\mu$}sec).},

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses (`flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 Ws to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption crosssection decreased by about 40\%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of cPS II, p, and the kinetics of Q3A reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energyconversion. \ss{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Our recent demonstration of the unusually effective photoprotection by the xanthophyll cycle in diatoms [Lavaud et al. (2002) Plant Physiol 129 (3) (in press)] also revealed that failure of this protection led to inactivation of oxygen evolution, but not to the expected photoinhibition. Photo-oxidative damage might be prevented by an electron transfer cycle around Photosystem II (PS II). The induction of such a cycle at high light intensity was verified by measurements of the flash number dependence of oxygen production in a series of single-turnover flashes. After a few minutes of saturating illumination, the oxygen flash yields are temporarily decreased. The deficit in oxygen production amounts to at most 3 electrons per PS II, but continues to reappear with a half time of 2 min in the dark until the total pool of reducing equivalents accumulated during the illumination has been consumed by (chloro)respiration. This is attributed to an electron transfer pathway from the plastoquinone pool or the acceptor side of PS II to the donor side of PS II that is insignificant at limiting light intensity but is accelerated to milliseconds at excess light intensity. Partial filling of the 3-equivalents capacity of the cyclic electron transfer path in PS II may prevent both acceptor-side photoinhibition in oxygen-evolving PS II and donor-side photoinhibition when the oxygen-evolving complex is temporarily inactivated.},

  abstract = {Water quality deterioration is expected to worsen the light conditions in shallow coastal waters with increasing human activities. Temperate seagrasses are known to tolerate a highly fluctuating light environment. However, depending on their ability to adjust to some decline in light conditions, decreases in daily light quantity and quality could affect seagrass physiology, productivity, and, eventually, survival if the Minimum Quantum Requirements (MQR) are not reached. To better understand if, how, and to what extent photosynthetic adjustments contribute to light acclimation, eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) shoots from the cold temperate St. Lawrence marine estuary (Rimouski, QC, Canada) were exposed to seven light intensity treatments (6, 36, 74, 133, 355, 503, and 860 {$\mu$}mol photons m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1, 14:10 light:dark photoperiod). Photosynthetic capacity and efficiency were quantified after five and 25 days of light exposure by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry to assess the rapid response of the photosynthetic apparatus and its acclimation potential. Photoacclimation was also studied through physiological responses of leaves and shoots (gross and net primary production, pigment content, and light absorption). Shoots showed proof of photosynthetic adjustments at irradiances below 200 {$\mu$}mol photons m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1, which was identified as the threshold between limiting and saturating irradiances. Rapid Light Curves (RLC) and net primary production (NPP) rates revealed sustained maximal photosynthetic rates from the highest light treatments down to 74 {$\mu$}mol photons m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1, while a compensation point (NPP = 0) of 13.7 {$\mu$}mol photons m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1 was identified. In addition, an important package effect was observed, since an almost three-fold increase in chlorophyll content in the lowest compared to the highest light treatment did not change the leaves' light absorption. These results shed new light on photosynthetic and physiological processes, triggering light acclimation in cold temperate eelgrass. Our study documents an MQR value for eelgrass in the St. Lawrence estuary, which is highly pertinent in the context of conservation and restoration of eelgrass meadows.},

  abstract = {A model was constructed which includes electron transport (linear and cyclic and Mehler type reaction) coupled to proton translocation, counter ion movement, ATP synthesis, and Calvin-Benson cycle. The focus is on modeling of the light-induced total electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}) which in this model originates from the bulk phase electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}b), the localized electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}c), as well as the surface electric potential difference ({$\Delta\Psi$}s). The measured dual wavelength transmittance signal ({$\Delta$}A515\textendash 560nm, electrochromic shift) was used as a proxy for experimental {$\Delta\Psi$}. The predictions for theoretical {$\Delta\Psi$} vary with assumed contribution of {$\Delta\Psi$}s, which might imply that the measured {$\Delta$}A515\textendash 560nm trace on a long time scale reflects the interplay of the {$\Delta\Psi$} components. Simulations also show that partitioning of proton motive force (pmf) to {$\Delta\Psi$}b and {$\Delta$}pH components is sensitive to the stoichiometric ratio of H+/ATP, energy barrier for ATP synthesis, ionic strength, buffer capacity and light intensity. Our model shows that high buffer capacity promotes the establishment of {$\Delta\Psi$}b, while the formation of pHi minimum is not `dissipated' but `postponed' until it reaches the same level as that for low buffer capacity. Under physiologically optimal conditions, the output of the model shows that at steady state in light, the {$\Delta$}pH component is the main contributor to pmf to drive ATP synthesis while a low {$\Delta\Psi$}b persists energizing the membrane. Our model predicts 11mV as the resting electric potential difference across the thylakoid membrane in dark. We suggest that the model presented in this work can be integrated as a module into a more comprehensive model of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

Through evolution, genetic drift, and speciation, photosynthetic organisms have discovered many solutions for light harvesting. In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules. In the latter half of the article, we focus on the lightharvesting complexes of purple bacteria as a model to illustrate the present understanding of the synergetic effects leading to EET optimization of light-harvesting antenna systems while exploring the structure and function of the integral chromophores. We end this review with a brief overview of the energy-transfer dynamics and pathways in the light-harvesting antennas of various photosynthetic organisms.},

Measured parameters included cell number and size, cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas, lipid and pigment contents, concentration of key proteins of the photosynthetic system, photosynthetic parameters based on both variable fluorescence and carbon assimilation, and the level of nonphotochemical quenching. A stable functional state was reached within a few days after the transition to dark and was then maintained throughout 3 months of darkness. The dark period resulted in a decrease of lipid droplet cell quota (-6\%), chlorophyll a cell quota (-41\%) and the maximum carbon fixation rate per cell (-98\%). Return to light after 1.5 months of darkness resulted in a strong induction of nonphotochemical quenching of excitation and a fast recovery of the maximum carbon fixation rate within 1 d, followed by a rapid increase in the cell number. Return to light after 3 months of darkness showed an increase of mortality or a profound downregulation induced over longer periods of darkness.},

Two prior crystal structures of OaPAC in the dark state, and mutagenesis experiments, indicate that the activation mechanism involves only very small movements, but we have now succeeded in refining the structure of the light-activated protein to high resolution, showing in molecular detail the changes at the chromophore on light exposure and allowing precise comparison of the structure in the light-exposed and dark states. The differences between these structures indicate the very small but concerted shifts that trigger enzyme activity tens of \aa ngstroms from the chromophore., The photoactivated adenylate cyclase (PAC) from the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) detects light through a flavin chromophore within the N-terminal BLUF domain. BLUF domains have been found in a number of different light-activated proteins, but with different relative orientations. The two BLUF domains of OaPAC are found in close contact with each other, forming a coiled coil at their interface. Crystallization does not impede the activity switching of the enzyme, but flash cooling the crystals to cryogenic temperatures prevents the signature spectral changes that occur on photoactivation/deactivation. High-resolution crystallographic analysis of OaPAC in the fully activated state has been achieved by cryocooling the crystals immediately after light exposure. Comparison of the isomorphous light- and dark-state structures shows that the active site undergoes minimal changes, yet enzyme activity may increase up to 50-fold, depending on conditions. The OaPAC models will assist the development of simple, direct means to raise the cyclic AMP levels of living cells by light, and other tools for optogenetics.},

To explore the life of phytoplankton during and after the polar night, we used robotic ice-avoiding profiling floats to measure ocean optics and phytoplankton characteristics continuously through two annual cycles in Baffin Bay, an Arctic sea that is covered by ice for 7 months a year. We demonstrate that net phytoplankton growth occurred even under 100\% ice cover as early as February and that it resulted at least partly from photosynthesis. This highlights the adaptation of Arctic phytoplankton to extreme low-light conditions, which may be key to their survival before seeding the spring bloom.},

  abstract = {In the recombination process of Photosystem II (S2QA-\textrightarrow S1QA) the limiting step is the electron transfer from the reduced primary acceptor pheophytin Ph- to the oxidized primary donor P+ and the rate depends on the equilibrium constant between states S2PPhQA- and S1P+Ph-QA. Accordingly, mutations that affect the midpoint potential of Ph or of P result in a modified recombination rate. A strong correlation is observed between the effects on the recombination rate and on thermoluminescence (TL, the light emission from S2QA- during a warming ramp): a slower recombination corresponds to a large enhancement and higher temperature of the TL peak. The current theory of TL does not account for these effects, because it is based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step coincides with the radiative process. When implementing the known fact that the radiative pathway represents a minor leak, the modified TL theory readily accounts qualitatively for the observed behavior. However, the peak temperature is still lower than predicted from the temperature-dependence of recombination. We argue that this reflects the heterogeneity of the recombination process combined with the enhanced sensitivity of TL to slower components. The recombination kinetics are accurately fitted as a sum of two exponentials and we show that this is not due to a progressive stabilization of the charge-separated state, but to a pre-existing conformational heterogeneity.},

Constraints on the ability to grow at very low fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation fall into three categories. Category one includes essential processes whose efficiency is independent of the rate of energy input, but whose catalysts show phylogenetic variation leading to different energy costs for a given process in different taxa, e.g. light-harvesting complexes, RUBISCO and probably in the sensitivity of PsII to photodamage. The second category comprises essential processes whose efficiency decreases with decreasing energy input rate as a result of back-reactions independent of the energy input rate, e.g. charge recombination following charge separation by PsII and short-circuit H+ fluxes across the thylakoid membrane which decrease the fraction of pumped H+ which can be used in adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation. Category two also includes that component of protein turnover which cannot be related to replacement of polypeptides which were incorrectly assembled following uncorrected errors of transcription or translation, or which were damaged by processes whose rate increases with increasing energy input rate such as photodamage to PsII. The third category includes only O2-dependent damage to the D1 protein of PsII whose rate increases with a decreasing incident flux of photosynthetically active radiation. Processes in categories two and three are most likely to impose the lower limit on the photon flux density which can support photolithotrophic growth. The available literature, mainly on organisms which are not adapted to growth at very low photon flux densities, suggests that three major limitations (charge recombination in PsII, H+ leakage and slippage, and protein turnover) can individually impose lower limits in excess of 20\hspace{0.166em}nmol photon m-2\hspace{0.166em}s-1 on photolithotrophic growth. Furthermore, these three limitations are interactive, so that considering all three processes acting in series leads to an even higher predicted lower photon flux density limit for photolithotrophic growth.},

We distinguish between uncoupling by proton slip, which means a decrease of the H+/e--ratio due to less efficient proton pumping, and proton leak as defined by enhanced kinetics of proton efflux. Proton slip and proton leak made about equal contributions to the total uncoupling. The enhanced proton efflux kinetics corresponded to reduction of subunit CF1-{$\gamma$} of the ATP synthase as shown by fluorescence labeling of thylakoid proteins with the sulfhydryl probe 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein. The maximum value of the fraction of reduced CF1-{$\gamma$} was only 36\%, which indicates that in vivo the reduction of CF1-{$\gamma$} could be limited by fast reoxidation and/or restricted accessibility of CF1-{$\gamma$} to thioredoxin. Measurements of the ratio ATP/2e indicated that only the uncoupling related to less efficient proton pumping led to a decrease in the ATP yield.},

  abstract = {Iron limitation is the major factor controlling phytoplankton growth in vast regions of the contemporary oceans. In this study, a combination of thermoluminescence (TL), chlorophyll fluorescence, and P700 absorbance measurements have been used to elucidate the effects of iron deficiency in the photosynthetic electron transport of the marine diatom P. tricornutum. TL was used to determine the effects of iron deficiency on photosystem II (PSII) activity. Excitation of iron-replete P. tricornutum cells with single turn-over flashes induced the appearance of TL glow curves with two components with different peaks of temperature and contributions to the total signal intensity: the B band (23\textdegree C, 63\%), and the AG band (40\textdegree C, 37\%). Iron limitation did not significantly alter these bands, but induced a decrease of the total TL signal. Far red excitation did not increase the amount of the AG band in iron-limited cells, as observed for iron-replete cells. The effect of iron deficiency on the photosystem I (PSI) activity was also examined by measuring the changes in P700 redox state during illumination. The electron donation to PSI was substantially reduced in iron-deficient cells. This could be related with the important decline on cytochrome c6 content observed in these cells. Iron deficiency also induced a marked increase in light sensitivity in P. tricornutum cells. A drastic increase in the level of peroxidation of chloroplast lipids was detected in iron-deficient cells even when grown under standard conditions at low light intensity. Illumination with a light intensity of 300 {$\mu$}E m-2 s-1 during different time periods caused a dramatic disappearance in TL signal in cells grown under low iron concentration, this treatment not affecting to the signal in iron-replete cells. The results of this work suggest that iron deficiency induces partial blocking of the electron transfer between PSII and PSI, due to a lower concentration of the electron donor cytochrome c6. This decreased electron transfer may induce the over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool and consequently the appearance of acceptor side photoinhibition in PSII even at low light intensities. The functionality of chlororespiratory electron transfer pathway under iron restricted conditions is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton photosynthetic physiology can be investigated through single-turnover variable chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) approaches, which carry unique potential to autonomously collect data at high spatial and temporal resolution. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in the development and application of ST-ChlF methods in aquatic ecosystems, and in the interpretation of the resulting observations. At the same time, however, an increasing number of sensor types, sampling protocols, and data processing algorithms have created confusion and uncertainty among potential users, with a growing divergence of practice among different research groups. In this review, we assist the existing and upcoming user community by providing an overview of current approaches and consensus recommendations for the use of ST-ChlF measurements to examine in-situ phytoplankton productivity and photo-physiology. We argue that a consistency of practice and adherence to basic operational and quality control standards is critical to ensuring data inter-comparability. Large datasets of inter-comparable and globally coherent ST-ChlF observations hold the potential to reveal large-scale patterns and trends in phytoplankton photo-physiology, photosynthetic rates and bottom-up controls on primary productivity. As such, they hold great potential to provide invaluable physiological observations on the scales relevant for the development and validation of ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms.},

  abstract = {Significance             Controls on phytoplankton productivity in the extreme environment of the Southern Ocean has received widespread attention. This polar region presents three challenges to primary producers: how to subsist under the joint constraints of low temperatures, low light, and growth-limiting concentrations of the essential trace element iron. The resident phytoplankton have overcome these extreme environmental conditions with a unique combination of physiological adaptations. They have modified parts of their photosynthetic machinery to harvest low levels of light without substantially increasing their iron requirements, and in a way that may exploit the low temperature in their environment. Together, these adaptations enable them to use iron and light more efficiently and grow faster than environmental conditions should otherwise permit.           ,                             Phytoplankton productivity in the polar Southern Ocean (SO) plays an important role in the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean's interior, a process called the biological carbon pump, which helps regulate global climate. SO productivity in turn is limited by low iron, light, and temperature, which restrict the efficiency of the carbon pump. Iron and light can colimit productivity due to the high iron content of the photosynthetic photosystems and the need for increased photosystems for low-light acclimation in many phytoplankton. Here we show that SO phytoplankton have evolved critical adaptations to enhance photosynthetic rates under the joint constraints of low iron, light, and temperature. Under growth-limiting iron and light levels, three SO species had up to sixfold higher photosynthetic rates per photosystem II and similar or higher rates per mol of photosynthetic iron than temperate species, despite their lower growth temperature (3 vs. 18 \textdegree C) and light intensity (30 vs. 40 {$\mu$}mol quanta{$\cdot$}m               2               {$\cdot$}s               -1               ), which should have decreased photosynthetic rates. These unexpectedly high rates in the SO species are partly explained by their unusually large photosynthetic antennae, which are among the largest ever recorded in marine phytoplankton. Large antennae are disadvantageous at low light intensities because they increase excitation energy loss as heat, but this loss may be mitigated by the low SO temperatures. Such adaptations point to higher SO production rates than environmental conditions should otherwise permit, with implications for regional ecology and biogeochemistry.},
